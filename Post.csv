India vs Australia: Shardul was eager to get to his fifty, I knew a six was coming, says Sundar, BRISBANE (Australia): The record-breaking partnership between India's Shardul Thakur and Washington Sundar was the highlight of day three of the fourth Test against Australia. Interestingly, Shardul began his innings with a six and also got to his half-century by hitting a stunning six. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) posted a video of Ravichandran Ashwin interviewing Shardul, Sundar, and T Natarajan. R Ashwin turns anchor at the GabbaDecoding a gritty century stand & a fairytale entry to international cricket.‚Ä¶ https://t.co/WbHMXBLRnh‚Äî BCCI (@BCCI) 1610887628000Reflecting on beginning his innings by hitting a six, Shardul said: "At that time, I did not look to hit six, it was more of a reaction. I saw the ball and played that shot instinctively and it came out well for me." Ashwin then asked Sundar about how he felt when Shardul struck a scintillating six to get to his fifty. "Starting six is Ok. What about the six to get to his fifty. How did you feel from the non-striker's end," Ashwin asked. To this, Sundar said: "I knew it was coming, to be honest. He was trying for a six to Lyon for some time and I knew it was coming and he was very eager to get to his half-century." Ashwin asked Shardul to talk him through those "Vivian Richards-type cover drives" and the latter said: "I have not really practiced those. It was one of those days where I was batting really well and did not want to miss any opportunity. Any loose ball and I just felt like putting it away." India were bundled out for 336, falling 33 runs short of the hosts' first-innings total. Shardul top-scored for India as he made 67 runs while Sundar accumulated 62 runs. Thakur and Sundar's 123-run resilient partnership enabled visitors to reach the 300-run mark after losing six wickets under 190 runs in the first innings. The duo also registered the highest seventh-wicket partnership for India at The Gabba, Brisbane. Thakur and Sundar broke Kapil Dev and Manoj Prabhakar's 58-run partnership record for the seventh-wicket set in 1991. At stumps, Australia were at 21/0 in their second innings. The hosts are leading by 54 runs. David Warner is unbeaten on 20 runs while Marcus Harris is not out on one run. , https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-80315483,imgsize-142933,width-400,resizemode-4/80315483.jpg
ISL: FC Goa score late goal to hold ATK Mohun Bagan to 1-1 draw, MARGAO: A late equaliser by youngster Ishan Pandita helped FC Goa play out a 1-1 draw against ATK Mohun Bagan in an Indian Super League match on Sunday. Substitute Pandita's goal came in the 85th minute after a 75th-minute free-kick strike from Edu Garcia had put ATKMB ahead. Both the teams played an exciting and evenly fought match, trading missed opportunities. Spoils shared after an entertaining 90 minutes#FCGoa 1-1 #ATKMohunBagan#JoyMohunBagan #IndianFootball #FCGATKMB https://t.co/dqc8vbO7Gz‚Äî ATK Mohun Bagan FC (@atkmohunbaganfc) 1610903801000The first half played itself out in predictable terms. FC Goa dominated possession they had 62 per cent of the ball in that period and sprayed passes around the pitch while ATKMB maintained their shape and ensured their opponents did not get many clear chances. Both the sides, however, managed to find the crossbar in the opening half. The Gaurs finish the game strongly but had to settle for a draw, courtesy Ishan's second goal of the season! üí™üèªWe‚Ä¶ https://t.co/Z2MN72LW21‚Äî FC Goa (@FCGoaOfficial) 1610899758000ATKMB went close in the 27th minute off a corner by Garcia. His delivery was headed into the ground by Subasish Bose. The ball bounced and looped over FC Goa keeper Naveen Kumar's head. Unfortunately for ATKMB, it struck the crossbar and bounced back into play. FC Goa returned the favour just four minutes later when Seriton Fernandes and Alberto Noguera played a quick one-two, before sending the former free on the right flank. Seriton looked to square the ball but was unable to find a teammate in the area. That moment of hesitation allowed Sandesh Jhingan to get a foot on the ball but the deflection took it over ATKMB keeper Arindam Bhattacharja and onto the crossbar. FC Goa started looking more threatening after that. In the 36th minute, Bhattacharja was called into action, to stop a Saviour Gama shot. FC Goa nearly scored soon after the restart. In the 50th minute, Seriton ran free down the right and looped a cross into the box, that eluded everyone. The ball crashed into the inside of the upright but somehow did not find the net. Six minutes later, Bhattacharja was alerted again to save a deflected shot from Brandon Fernandes. It was Juan Ferrando's men who were running the show after half time, but then, against the run of play, ATKMB found a goal. Roy Krishna was fouled by James Donachie just outside the box. ATKMB has always been threatening from set-pieces this season and this time was no different. Garcia stepped up and powered one into the right-hand corner of the net. When ATKMB score a late goal, it's usually the winner, but this time, there was a twist in the tale. With just minutes left on the clock, Pandita diverted it into the net from a corner to drag his team level. , https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-80316975,imgsize-168950,width-400,resizemode-4/80316975.jpg
Toss up between Ranji and Vijay Hazare; NZ to tour before T20 World Cup, NEW DELHI: The Indian cricket board (BCCI) will be conducting either Ranji Trophy or the Vijay Hazare one-day tournament this season. On Sunday evening, the BCCI apex council had a virtual meeting where it was decided that the board could host only one more senior men‚Äôs domestic tournament. A call will be taken in the coming week. "The board is keen to host the Ranji Trophy. There‚Äôs no time to organize both the tournaments. A decision will be taken in a few days' time," a senior BCCI official told TOI on Sunday. TOI has learnt that the state units are more keen on playing the Vijay Hazare tournament. The BCCI will maintain existing bubbles used for the ongoing Syed Mushtaq Ali tournament. However, the knockout phase of the Mushtaq Ali tournament will be played in Ahmedabad so that the revamped Motera stadium gets tested before hosting England for Tests and T20Is later in March. NZ to visit India before T20 WCThe New Zealand team will tour India before the T20 World Cup scheduled for October-November. It is learnt that the tour will have more T20Is and fewer Test matches just as a preparation for the marquee event. Talks are also on to get South Africa for a short series to compensate for the series which was cancelled due to the pandemic in March last year. The Future Tours Programme (FTP) will be discussed in a later meeting. Women's cricket to start from Feb; talks on with SL, SAThe domestic season for women will start in February which will be followed by the resumption of India's international cricket. It's likely that India women will start off with a series against Sri Lanka. "BCCI is in talks with Sri Lanka and South Africa to resume international cricket for its women's team. There were also discussions with England on the same," the official said. Rehiring of coaches at NCAThe National Cricket Academy (NCA) in Bengaluru will have coaches hired to kick start BCCI's programme of age group cricket. NCA didn't renew contracts of 11 coaches at NCA in September. NCA director Rahul Dravid has been tasked to carry out the process for resumption of full-fledged activities which will also include zonal camps. BCCI to host T20 WC irrespective of tax exemptionThe board has also decided that it will not let the tax exemption from the central government, as demanded by the ICC, to come in the way off hosting the T20 World Cup later this year. "BCCI is in talks with the government. Even if the desired exemption is not granted, the board will go ahead with hosting the World Cup. It may give up an amount from its ICC revenue kitty," the official claimed. IPL SOP for England seriesBCCI also decided that the same set of standard operating procedures (SOPs) will be implemented for the home series as it was used for the IPL in UAE in Oct-Nov. That means the teams will be in strict bio-bubbles. , https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-80316310,imgsize-610701,width-400,resizemode-4/80316310.jpg
I'm proud that Shardul stuck to my advice: Childhood coach Lad, MUMBAI: Used to answering reporters' constant calls whenever Rohit Sharma does well, Dinesh Lad, the Team India superstar's childhood coach, was mighty pleased to receive plenty of messages and phone calls for another of his wards, on Sunday morning. Rescuing India from a position when they looked in danger of conceding a huge first innings lead at 186 for six while replying to Australia's 369, Shardul Thakur slammed (67), adding 123 for the seventh wicket India's highest stand for this wicket against Australia to take his team to 336. Lad was happy that the fast bowler paid heed to an important advice from his coach in his budding years when he was playing for the Chennai Super Kings in IPL 2020. "I was very disappointed by Rohit's shot yesterday, as he was batting like a dream. However, I'm feeling really proud of Shardul because he has done today what I had asked him to do. I scolded him after he was out playing a cross-batted shot during IPL-2020. I asked him to play straight, concentrate on his batting too and score a few runs as everyone was looking at him as an all-rounder. He accepted his mistake and promised to stick to my advice. He was playing proper cricketing shots today," Lad told TOI. "It fills me with pride that two of the players I coached are now playing for India," said Lad. He is happy to have made an extremely important contribution to Thakur's career. "He struck my eye from the first time I saw him in 2006. Dimaag mein ghus gaya thaa (He was in my mind). I spoke to his father at least 20 times, and managed to convince him to shift him to my school (Swami Vivekanand International School) in Borivali. His father was apprehensive as they used to live in far-off Palghar. At that time, I offered my house for him to stay. I must thank my wife for agreeing to allow him to stay in my house. She deserves huge credit for Shardul's success. If she hadn't agreed to do so, Shardul wouldn't have reached where he has," said Lad. Thakur justified his coach's decision soon after joining SVIS. In a Harris Shield game in 2006, the then 15-year-old achieved a rare feat when he smashed six sixes in an over in a Harris Shield match. "Actually, my first-ever interview in the media was due to Shardul, and not Rohit," recalled Lad. , https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-80313857,imgsize-141773,width-400,resizemode-4/80313857.jpg
1st Test: Leach takes five wickets as nervous England near victory, GALLE (Sri Lanka): Left-arm spinner Jack Leach took five wickets as England edged towards victory over Sri Lanka in the first Test in Galle, but they made a nervous start to their pursuit of a modest target of 74 and closed day four on 38 for three on Sunday. Jonny Bairstow (11 not out) and debutant Dan Lawrence (7 not out) will lead the victory charge on the final day but must master a wicket offering prodigious turn that will leave Sri Lanka believing they are still in with a sniff of an upset. South Africa were skittled for 73 in their fourth innings in Galle in 2018 as the home side took 28.5 overs to take 10 wickets, a blueprint for their potential success in this match. England lost opener Dom Sibley (2) in the first over of their chase when he left a delivery from Lasith Embuldeniya (2-13) that clipped his off stump and Zak Crawley (8) soon followed, caught at slip by Kusal Mendis off the same bowler. There was disaster for the visitors when captain Joe Root (1), who scored a superb 228 in the first innings, was run out by a direct his from wicketkeeper Niroshan Dickwella to leave England teetering at 14 for three. It was a needless attempt at a single that showed the nerves of the visitors and Root's fifth run out in Tests since the start of 2018. Earlier, Sri Lanka were bowled out for 359 in their second innings as opener Lahiru Thirimanne scored his second Test century in 37 matches before being dismissed for 111. He was undone by the new ball when a delivery from Sam Curran (2-37) nipped back and was edged through to wicketkeeper Jos Buttler. Off-spinner Dom Bess (3-100) chipped away at the Sri Lanka middle-order, picking up the wickets of nightwatchman Embuldeniya (0), captain Dinesh Chandimal (20) and Dickwella (29) as he finished with eight wickets in the match. All-rounder Angelo Mathews (71) batted well with the tail to frustrate the visitors and allow them to set some sort of target, his 219-ball vigil finally ended by Leach (5-122) when he edged to Root at slip. Leach was getting considerable turn on the crumbling surface and looked threatening with virtually every ball. He provided a first stumping for Buttler in Test cricket when he removed Dilruwan Perera (24). , https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-80314722,imgsize-686003,width-400,resizemode-4/80314722.jpg
Shardul, Washington batted brilliantly; we faltered in execution: Hazlewood, BRISBANE: Australia speedster Josh Hazlewood on Sunday credited Washington Sundar and Shardul Thakur for taking India to a safe position with their century stand but rued the execution of home team bowlers in finishing off the visitors tail on the third day of the series-deciding fourth Test here. In a spot of bother at 186 for six in reply to Australia's 369, debutant Washington (62) and Shardul (67) punched above their weights to stitch a "crucial" 123-run stand for the seventh wicket to help an inexperienced India finish their first innings at 336, 33 runs short of the hosts. "Yes, it is obviously a crucial partnership (between Shardul and Washington), but then we had them. I think, 6/200 around that mark, so we thought we (were) on top there but to be fair the guys batted really well," Hazlewood, who returned with figures of 5 for 57, said at the virtual post-day press conference. Washington Sundar registers highest score for No.7 debutant in Australia"We didn't probably execute well as we could have in that period but (we) created a few little half chances. On any other day, hopefully we take those, but credit to those two guys (Shardul and Washington). They batted beautifully and I think it just shows the wicket is pretty good." At stumps on day three, Australia were 21 for no loss in their second innings to extend their overall lead to 54 runs. Hazlewood conceded that Australia let a few moments slip in the day, which could have eventually made the difference. No stopping the Newcomers: Washington Sundar, Shardul Thakur keep India in contention"I thought the guys did bowl really well again and everyone else backed us up. Just let a few moments slip, I think, and also a few a half chances there. If we could have grabbed them, it could have made a little difference," the 30-year-old said. Hazlewood also said that the Australian bowlers failed to build enough pressure as they would have liked to against Shardul. 4th Test: India team has shown remarkable character, says Michael Vaughan"It is a bit of frustration obviously, sometimes when you reduce a team to six down and you are on your way to knock them over, but as I said teams bat all the way down, specially some of the teams like England. Credit to him (Shardul), we missed our marking a little-bit in that little period. "Probably bowled a touch short and bit of width here and there and just let him off the hook a little bit there and probably did not build the pressure, the way we wanted to. But again credit to him," he said during the briefing facilitated by official broadcaster Sony Network. 1/8IN PICS: Indian rookies thwart Aussie bowlers on Day 3 Previous NextShow CaptionsAfter their fine show with the ball by grabbing three wickets each, Washington Sundar and Shardul Thakur proved that they are no mugs with the bat either on Day 3 of the 4th Test against Australia at The Gabba.

(Getty Images)Pat Cummins broke the 123-run stand when he clean bowled Shardul for 67 to reduce India to 309/7. (AFP Photo)Hazlewood, however, was happy with the fact that they managed to remove India's batting mainstay Cheteshwar Pujara cheaply. "It is huge. He (Pujara) is obviously, probably the key wicket, one of the couple of key wickets there at the top order. If we can knock Pujara early, we get five, six, seven numbers in with a relatively hard and newish ball, so he plays a massive role for them and Patty (Pat Cummins) obviously has been on top of him this whole series," he said. "He has still batted a bit of time here and there but we have really squeezed on the runs and I think that is playing on in his mind and bringing to his downfall." Hazlewood said the match is at present evenly-poised and a call on declaration in their second innings will be made taking into consideration all factors, including the weather. "I think, the way it is set up, it is probably going to be both. Probably depends (on) who bats, if Davy (David Warner) bats a long time, things happen pretty quickly as we know. I think it will be pretty similar to maybe Sydney, three-three and half sessions, maybe four sessions," he said. "It all depends on probably the weather as well, a bit of rain forecast in the afternoon on both days, so that could come into calculations but, we will bat normal for the first two sessions tomorrow and see where we are." , https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-80313481,imgsize-477098,width-400,resizemode-4/80313481.jpg
Twenty-five more players in Australian Open quarantine, MELBOURNE: An additional 25 players will have to spend two weeks in quarantine before the Australian Open, organisers said Sunday, as Covid-19 continues to disrupt preparations for the Grand Slam tournament. The players were on a flight from Doha to Melbourne on which one passenger, who is not one of the players, tested positive for coronavirus having tested negative before the flight. They will join 47 players already confined to their rooms for 14 days in Melbourne, meaning a total of 72 players are now unable to leave their hotel rooms for two weeks. "There were 58 passengers on the flight, including 25 players. All are already in quarantine hotels," tournament organisers said in a statement on Twitter. #AusOpen update... https://t.co/x7m34jhqns‚Äî #AusOpen (@AustralianOpen) 1610888318000"The 25 players on the flight will not be able to leave their hotel room for 14 days and until they are medically cleared. They will not be eligible to practise," the organisers added. Australian Open chief Craig Tiley insisted Sunday, before the announcement that 25 more players were to be quarantined, that the tournament would begin as scheduled on February 8. French player Alize Cornet tweeted on Saturday that the situation was "insane" before later deleting the post. , https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-80316180,imgsize-508802,width-400,resizemode-4/80316180.jpg
Jaguars, Chargers fire head coaches in annual NFL purge, The Jacksonville Jaguars and Los Angeles Chargers parted ways with their respective head coaches on Monday as the annual purge of personnel continued for underperforming teams across the National Football League (NFL). A day after the 2-14 New York Jets fired Adam Gase, the Jaguars let go of head coach Doug Marrone after a 1-15 season, the worst record in the NFL, and the Chargers dismissed Anthony Lynn after two consecutive losing campaigns. Marrone led the Jaguars to the AFC Championship game in the first of his four years in the role, which they lost 24-20 to the New England Patriots. However, he was unable to sustain the momentum and the team finished last in the AFC South in the following three seasons. "I am committed and determined to deliver winning football to the City of Jacksonville," Jaguars owner Shad Khan said in a statement on Marrone's departure. "Realizing that goal requires a fresh start throughout our football operations." The Jaguars head coaching position is widely considered as one of the most attractive in the league since the team has the first overall pick in the 2021 NFL Draft. "Now the quest begins to find a head coach who shares my ambition for the Jacksonville Jaguars and our fans, whose loyalty and faith are overdue to be rewarded," added Khan. Lynn, a former offensive coordinator for the Buffalo Bills who the Chargers hired in 2017, is leaving Los Angeles after lacklustre 5-11 and 7-9 records in 2019 and 2020 respectively. "This is a results-driven business and, simply put, the results of the past two years have fallen short of expectations," Chargers owner Dean Spanos said in a statement. "Moving forward, we will redouble our efforts to both build and maintain a championship-caliber program." , https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-80102335,imgsize-45696,width-400,resizemode-4/80102335.jpg
Ozil confirms Fenerbahce move in Turkish TV interview, ISTANBUL: Mesut Ozil confirmed on Sunday that he was leaving Arsenal for Turkish team Fenerbahce after being frozen out for months at the Gunners. "I'm very happy, very excited. God has given me the chance to wear the Fenerbahce shirt. I will wear it with pride and give everything for the team," Ozil said in an interview with Turkish television channel NTV. Former Germany forward Ozil said that he would be travelling to Istanbul with his family on Sunday evening, bringing to an end a seven-and-a-half year relationship with Arsenal that turned sour under current coach Mikel Arteta. The 32-year-old has not played for the Premier League team since March 2020 and his reported deal on a weekly salary of ¬£350,000 ($475,000) was set to expire at the end of the current season. However he claimed in Sunday's interview that he is "in good physical condition" despite his lengthy period on the sidelines. Sports daily Fanatik reports that Ozil will sign a three-and-a-half year deal with Fenerbahce worth five million euros a season. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's spokesman Ibrahim Kalin responding to an earlier post on social media from Ozil of two hearts in Fenerbahce's colours tweeted: "Safe trip home". Ozil, who is of Turkish origin, was heavily criticised in Germany for posing for a photograph with Erdogan in 2018. Erdogan was also the best man at the player's wedding in Turkey. Ozil was a key part of Germany's 2014 World Cup-winning side but after what he labelled "racist" attacks following the holders' first-round exit at the 2018 tournament, he ended his international career. Fenerbahce, one of Istanbul's three big clubs, are currently second in the league behind Besiktas. After starting the first 10 games of Mikel Arteta's reign as Arsenal boss, Ozil has not featured since a 1-0 win over West Ham before the coronavirus pandemic saw football grind to a halt last year. He was omitted from Arsenal's Premier League and Europa League squads, with Arteta and technical director Edu insisting the decision to do so was down to footballing reasons. In December 2019, Arsenal also distanced themselves from comments Ozil made on social media criticising China's treatment of the Uighur population. The early years of Ozil's career at the Emirates after a ¬£42.5 million move from Real Madrid in 2013 were a success. He played a major role in winning three FA Cups in four years, but became a peripheral figure after Arsene Wenger departed as manager in 2018, just five months after Ozil had signed his bumper three-year deal. , https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-80316770,imgsize-696033,width-400,resizemode-4/80316770.jpg

Argentina tour will be a good indicator of where we stand: Women's hockey skipper Rani, BUENOS AIRES: The Indian women's hockey team skipper Rani feels the tour of Argentina will help her side "understand where they stand", nearly a year after the COVID-19 pandemic abruptly halted all competitions around the world. The women's side will become the first of India's hockey teams to resume international matches as it plays the first of the eight games during the tour of Argentina, starting Sunday. "It has been a strange period for sports people around the world, but to be resuming doing what we love the most, it is the best feeling," Rani was quoted as saying in a Hockey India media release. "We are looking forward to testing ourselves against some strong teams, and also understanding where we stand at the moment," she added. Rani reiterated that a good show in the series will boost her side's confidence heading into this year's Tokyo Olympics. "I think this tour is really important for us in terms of resuming competitive hockey. "We have a crucial year to look forward to, and with such matches against strong sides, we will be able to keep working hard towards our goal of preparing well for the Tokyo Olympics," Rani said. The 26-year-old forward knows the importance of starting the all-important Olympic year well, but also understands that it will take time to get into the groove after staying away from competitions for nearly a year. "We know what our aim is this year, and we want to make sure that we start the year in the perfect manner, put in some excellent performances, and build some momentum again," Rani said. "However, we also understand and take into consideration that we haven't played an international match with the maximum intensity in these past 9-10 months, and that we might take time to get back into our groove, and that is what this tour is all about," she added. , https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-80300942,imgsize-153302,width-400,resizemode-4/80300942.jpg
Indian women hockey team working on PC conversion and defence: Gurjit, BUENOS AIRES: Gearing up for its first international assignment in almost a year, drag-flicker Gurjit Kaur on Thursday said the Indian women hockey team is paying more attention to penalty corner conversion and defence ahead of its clash against formidable Argentina. The Indian team will begin the eight-match tour against the world number two side on Sunday. "Playing against a strong team like Argentina on their home ground won't be easy but our focus will be on bringing out our best play against them. We worked really hard on our fitness over the past 11 months in SAI and the aim was to return to our best form. It is against teams like Argentina where we can test our potential," said Gurjit. "We have been here nearly 10 days and have got a few sessions on the pitch. We have paid extra attention to areas such as PC conversion and PC defending. We need to be alert in our defence if we have to do well against Argentina," she said in a release issued by Hockey India. Gurjit also emphasised on the importance of following protocols due to the on-going COVID-19 pandemic. "We are extremely grateful to Hockey India and the Argentina Federation for ensuring a safe bio-bubble environment here. We are in a good hotel which is about 20-25 minutes' drive from the ground. The food is good and SOPs on the ground is also followed. It's important to be responsible and just focus on the job at hand," she said. , https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-80266880,imgsize-72946,width-400,resizemode-4/80266880.jpg
ISL: NorthEast United return to winning ways, beat Jamshedpur FC 2-1, VASCO: NorthEast United FC defeated Jamshedpur FC 2-1 to end their seven-game winless streak in the Indian Super League on Sunday. The win propelled NEUFC to the fifth spot in the standings with 16 points.

NEUFC were the better side in the opening half, dominating possession and creating goal-scoring opportunities. They deservedly went into the break with a one-goal cushion which could have been more, but for some fine saves by JFC goalkeeper TP Rehenesh. It was Jamshedpur who created the first big chance of the game in the eighth minute but NEUFC custodian Subasish Roy Chowdhury denied them the opener. After Jamshedpur won a throw-in, Khassa Camara's poor clearance fell towards Nerijus Valskis, who found Jadhav just outside the box. The youngster, in turn, whipped a cross for Valskis, who controlled the ball and struck on the volley but saw his shot blocked by Chowdhury. The best chance for NEUFC came in the 32nd minute. Luis Machado, a constant livewire in the first half, came close to breaking the deadlock but Rehenesh did well to keep it out thanks to a brilliant acrobatic effort. Suhair VP delivered a cross for the Portuguese, who attempted an overhead kick which was parried away. Just four minutes later, NEUFC made amends for it as they scored from a set-piece. Federico Gallego delivered a delicious cross from the corner flag and Mehta rose above his marker at the far post to head the ball into the net. Jamshedpur started strong in the second half, pushing their opponents on the back foot. However, a defensive error saw them concede again. Isaac Vanmalsawma, brought on at half-time, gave the ball away after a sloppy pass. Gallego received the ball from Machado and threaded a through pass for substitute Brown, who slotted it past Rehenesh. Jamshedpur had a chance to cut down their deficit after Chowdhury put himself in trouble, courtesy of a miscued goal kick. The ball was intercepted by Valskis, who made a run into the box and shot on goal but Chowdhury redeemed himself with a crucial save. Coyle's side received a glimmer of hope late on in the game after captain Hartley scored through a corner, which was his first for Jamshedpur. They continued to test NEUFC and could have bagged a dramatic equaliser in injury time but Valskis fluffed the chance. Hartley played a long ball for the Lithuanian who blazed his header over the bar. , https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-80315964,imgsize-109120,width-400,resizemode-4/80315964.jpg
Toss up between Ranji and Vijay Hazare; NZ to tour before T20 World Cup, NEW DELHI: The Indian cricket board (BCCI) will be conducting either Ranji Trophy or the Vijay Hazare one-day tournament this season. On Sunday evening, the BCCI apex council had a virtual meeting where it was decided that the board could host only one more senior men‚Äôs domestic tournament. A call will be taken in the coming week. "The board is keen to host the Ranji Trophy. There‚Äôs no time to organize both the tournaments. A decision will be taken in a few days' time," a senior BCCI official told TOI on Sunday. TOI has learnt that the state units are more keen on playing the Vijay Hazare tournament. The BCCI will maintain existing bubbles used for the ongoing Syed Mushtaq Ali tournament. However, the knockout phase of the Mushtaq Ali tournament will be played in Ahmedabad so that the revamped Motera stadium gets tested before hosting England for Tests and T20Is later in March. NZ to visit India before T20 WCThe New Zealand team will tour India before the T20 World Cup scheduled for October-November. It is learnt that the tour will have more T20Is and fewer Test matches just as a preparation for the marquee event. Talks are also on to get South Africa for a short series to compensate for the series which was cancelled due to the pandemic in March last year. The Future Tours Programme (FTP) will be discussed in a later meeting. Women's cricket to start from Feb; talks on with SL, SAThe domestic season for women will start in February which will be followed by the resumption of India's international cricket. It's likely that India women will start off with a series against Sri Lanka. "BCCI is in talks with Sri Lanka and South Africa to resume international cricket for its women's team. There were also discussions with England on the same," the official said. Rehiring of coaches at NCAThe National Cricket Academy (NCA) in Bengaluru will have coaches hired to kick start BCCI's programme of age group cricket. NCA didn't renew contracts of 11 coaches at NCA in September. NCA director Rahul Dravid has been tasked to carry out the process for resumption of full-fledged activities which will also include zonal camps. BCCI to host T20 WC irrespective of tax exemptionThe board has also decided that it will not let the tax exemption from the central government, as demanded by the ICC, to come in the way off hosting the T20 World Cup later this year. "BCCI is in talks with the government. Even if the desired exemption is not granted, the board will go ahead with hosting the World Cup. It may give up an amount from its ICC revenue kitty," the official claimed. IPL SOP for England seriesBCCI also decided that the same set of standard operating procedures (SOPs) will be implemented for the home series as it was used for the IPL in UAE in Oct-Nov. That means the teams will be in strict bio-bubbles. , https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-80316310,imgsize-610701,width-400,resizemode-4/80316310.jpg

Winning over Aussie crowd was Shardul Thakur's inspiration behind gritty knock, BRISBANE: When Shardul Thakur stepped out to bat on Sunday, rescuing India from a precarious 186/6 was not the only target on his mind as he was also keen to impress the Australian crowd after being told how "rewarding" it would feel by coach Ravi Shastri. India were staring down the barrel at 186 for six on the third day of the fourth and final Test but Thakur (67) joined hands with debutant Washington Sundar (62) for a combative 123-run seventh wicket stand which helped his team cut down Australia's first innings lead to just 33 runs. I'm no dud with the bat, says unlikely India batting hero Shardul Thakur"When I walked in, the situation was difficult. I would not deny that. The crowd was cheering for Australians bowlers. But I remembered our coach Ravi Shastri saying right at the start of the One-day series that 'if you perform in this country, you will be rewarded'," Thakur talked about the inspiration behind the unfazed manner with which he batted. "People will love you for your performances and that one thing was also on my mind that people are going love me. Batting at number eight, Thakur impressed with his stroke-play, his drives coming straight out of coaching manuals. At stumps, Australia were 54 ahead after reaching 21 for no loss in their second innings following India's dismissal for 336. "Eventually at the end of the day it would help my team, that was the biggest positive. These two things were on my mind. Crowd would make noise, but If I bat well, the same crowd will cheer for me," Thakur said at a virtual post-play press conference. Cheered, he definitely was by not just the crowd but also his teammates, who gave him a standing ovation on his way back to the dressing room. Thakur spoke about his love for batting and how he waited for such an opportunity. "I have some batting talent. Whenever the throw-down specialists with the team are available, I practice. These are the moments you train and wait for and you could so something for the team. The idea was to spend time, it would add runs and deficit will also decrease." He also admitted that travelling with the A team in this part of the world has helped him improve his skills. 1/8IN PICS: Indian rookies thwart Aussie bowlers on Day 3 Previous NextShow CaptionsAfter their fine show with the ball by grabbing three wickets each, Washington Sundar and Shardul Thakur proved that they are no mugs with the bat either on Day 3 of the 4th Test against Australia at The Gabba.

Marin and Axelsen claim Thailand Open singles titles, BANGKOK: Reigning Olympic champion Carolina Marin bolstered her chances of defending in Tokyo later this year after claiming the Thailand Open in Bangkok Sunday over top seed Tai Tzu Ying. Despite having a cold, fourth seed Viktor Axelsen of Denmark was electric in the men's final against Hong Kong's Angus Long, ranked eighth, claiming the title in straight sets. Spaniard Marin, 27, a former world number one, was an imposing force with razor-sharp smashes, clever net work and an unmatched level of aggression and agility. She screamed in delight as she won match point in the second set after steam-rolling her 26-year-old opponent from Taiwan 21-9, 21-16 in 42 minutes. "I wanted to show her from the beginning that I wanted to win," Marin said. Tai admitted she wasn't able to keep pace and her condition wasn't up to scratch. "Carolina is always fast and aggressive. That is her playing style. Today she put a lot of pressure on me," Tai said. The first non-Asian women's player to win an Olympic badminton gold, Marin has faced an uphill battle to recover from a January 2019 knee injury in time to defend her crown in Tokyo. Axelsen, meanwhile, took just 44 minutes to triumph 21-14, 21-14 over Long. "I knew I had to be 110 percent going into the final. And having not played for so long, really happy that I managed to win," Axelsen said. Long said he was surprised to have made it so far, despite the loss. "I just didn't perform my best, maybe at 70 per cent today," he said. "This is the first tournament of 2021 and I certainly didn't expect to make it to the final." It was back-to-back tournament wins for the Dane, 10 months apart, after claiming the All England Badminton Championship in mid-March. The Thailand Open is the first of three consecutive tournaments in Bangkok culminating in the World Tour Finals from January 27. The players have been facing off in a bio-secure bubble minus spectators, although the tournament has been overshadowed by three positive coronavirus cases. Indonesia's Greysia Polii and Apriyani Rahayu were too good for Thailand's Jongkolphan Kititharakul and Rawinda Prajongjai in the women's doubles final, prevailing 21-15, 21-12. The win marked a record fourth title in Thailand for Polii. In the mixed doubles, top-seeded Thais Dechapol Puavaranukroh and Sapsiree Taerattanachai took eight minutes to claim the first game against Indonesia's Praveen Jordan and Melati Daeva Oktavianti 21-3. The second set was neck and neck with the home team going down 20-22, but the locals were too strong in the decider: 21-18. In the men's doubles Taiwan's Lee Yang and Wang Chi-Lin beat Malaysia's Goh V Shem and Tan Wee Kiong 16-21, 23-21, 19-21. The next tournament begins Tuesday. , https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-80314586,imgsize-543242,width-400,resizemode-4/80314586.jpg
I'm no dud with the bat, says unlikely India batting hero Shardul Thakur, Regular captain Virat Kohli led the tributes to Shardul Thakur's brave batting in the Brisbane decider but the number eight batsman was underwhelmed by his praise as he never considered himself a dud with the bat. Thakur, playing his second Test, emerged as India's unlikely batting hero, top-scoring with a counter-attacking 67 to deny Australia a substantial first-innings lead. Debutant Washington Sundar was his partner in a 123-run seventh-wicket stand as both made their maiden Test fifties in the fourth and final game of the series on Sunday. They were not even part of India's original squad but were shoehorned into the team following injuries to frontline bowlers. "Outstanding application and belief by @Sundarwashi5 and @imShard. This is what test cricket is all about," Kohli, who returned home after the opening test to attend the birth of his daughter, said on Twitter. Outstanding application and belief by @Sundarwashi5 and @imShard. This is what test cricket is all about. Washy top‚Ä¶ https://t.co/qpVrsJgpVf‚Äî Virat Kohli (@imVkohli) 1610866575000Thakur, who claimed three wickets in Australia's first innings, said he did not want to waste an opportunity to impress with the bat. "I do believe I have some batting talent," the seamer said in a video conference. "I do work on my batting in the nets. We wait for these moments, these opportunities, to contribute with the bat." Thakur brought up his fifty by hitting spinner Nathan Lyon for six and India, reeling at 186-6, were past the 300-mark when Pat Cummins pegged back his off-stump. "We were not even looking at the scoreboard. The idea was to spend some time there," Thakur said. "We knew that their bowlers were tiring out a bit, so if we could hang in for one more hour we could be on top." The 29-year-old said they patiently waited to punish loose balls. "If one of us lost focus or played a rash stroke, we'd immediately communicate with each other and say 'Let's go back to normal and do our basics'," he said. , https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-80313488,imgsize-87044,width-400,resizemode-4/80313488.jpg
'Sure I will get a big score': Washington Sundar to his dad before Gabba innings, NEW DELHI: While fans and former cricketers are pleasantly surprised at India's tail wagging with No. 7 and 8 scoring half-centuries, Washington Sundar's father is upset at his son for not getting a Test century. Sundar scored 62 off 144 balls and shared a 123-run seventh wicket partnership with Shardul Thakur, who made 67 on the third day of the fourth Test between India and Australia at The Gabba. Sundar was the ninth man to be dismissed. "I am disappointed he did not get a 100. When Siraj came, he should have hit fours and sixes. He is capable of that. He should have gone for sixes. He could have gone for pulls and big hits. Perhaps, he thought of trying to come close to Australia's total as the lead was very less," father M Sundar told IANS from Chennai. Washington-Shardul partnership was outstanding: Ponting"I speak to him in Australia every day. I told him last evening whenever you get a chance, get a big score. He said, 'sure I will'." There is a reason why M Sundar is upset. He knows his son is a very capable top-order batsman although he has been picked in the team only for the lower middle-order. Washington has played only 12 first-class matches but whenever he has got a chance, he has performed. He opened the innings against Mumbai at Lahli in his debut match for Tamil Nadu in the 2016-17 Ranji Trophy season. The ground at Lahli is more of an open field and aids seam bowling. But he shared a 107-run partnership for the first wicket with Abhinav Mukund on that surface. He also made 156 opening for TN against Tripura at the MA Chidambaram Stadium. It is a surprise that he hasn't featured in the TN Ranji side for over three years now. Shardul, Washington batted brilliantly; we faltered in execution: HazlewoodIn the Gabba Test, 21-year-old Sundar became only the third Indian player to score a fifty and take three wickets in an innings on debut. Those who have seen him play from up close, knew this all-round show was coming. Back in 2017, he was called up for the (pink-ball) Duleep Trophy final just a month short of his 18th birthday. The off-spinner and left-handed batsman picked 11 wickets (5/94 and 6/87) and scored 130 runs (88 in first innings & 42 in the second) to help India Red beat an India Blue side that comprised the likes Ishant Sharma, Pankaj Singh and Jaydev Unadkat as well as Suresh Raina. Washington Sundar registers highest score for No.7 debutant in Australia"After that Duleep Trophy performance we all thought he would be in the Test team. But he wasn't picked. We were disappointed," said M Sundar. Washington had first made an impression as a 15-year-old. He was in the NCA U-19 team but was picked in the NCA seniors team for a KSCA tournament. 1/8In Pics: Washington Sundar, Shardul Thakur drag India back into Brisbane Test Previous NextShow CaptionsWashington Sundar and Shardul Thakur gave India a fighting chance of securing the draw they need in the fourth Test against Australia to retain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.

The Haryana side included the likes of Joginder Sharma, Jayant Yadav and Yuzvendra Chahal. All those knocks came while opening the innings. "He is a natural opening batsman, and has scored a lot of runs against the new ball. In Chennai League, he is the youngest player to score a hundred in first division league. At the age of 14, he got a century while opening," added Sundar, who himself made it to the Tamil Nadu Ranji probable squad and named his son after his own mentor PD Washington. No stopping the Newcomers: Washington Sundar, Shardul Thakur keep India in contention"My mentor was called Washington. He helped me a lot in my career. Through gratefulness, I kept my son's name after him," explains the senior Sundar. M Sundar may not have been able to fulfill his cricket dreams but he is living them through his son, a Test cricketer now, and his daughter, who has played 42 first-class games for Tamil Nadu. , https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-80315030,imgsize-621567,width-400,resizemode-4/80315030.jpg
India vs Australia: 'A' tours have made transition to senior side easier, says Shardul Thakur, BRISBANE: India pacer Shardul Thakur on Sunday said that players who had represented the 'A' side now have experience of playing in overseas conditions before making it to the national squad. The Ajinkya Rahane-led side was bundled out for 336 in the first innings of the ongoing fourth Test at the Gabba and as a result, Australia gained a 33-run lead. India, at one stage, found themselves reeling at 186/6 but Shardul Thakur (67) and Washington Sundar (62) got together at the crease to form a crucial 123-run stand that helped the team get closer to the Australia's first innings total. "A-Tours are meant to give experience to your second lineup. It has helped a lot, we were here in 2016 and we played at the Allan Border Field. We played four-day games there, pitch there is different, but at least you are used to Australian conditions, when you take that leap from India A to the senior side, the transition is not that difficult, it is all about how you execute at the senior level," said Shardul during the post-match press conference. No stopping the Newcomers: Washington Sundar, Shardul Thakur keep India in contentionAt stumps, Australia ended the day at 21/0 and the hosts extended their lead to 54. David Warner (20*) and Marcus Harris (1*) remained unbeaten for the hosts. "I have the talent for batting, whenever there are throwdowns taking place in nets, I practice my batting, these are the type of moments for which we practice our batting. An opportunity presented itself in this match, I knew that the team would benefit if I stay at the crease for a long haul. I haven't batted with Sundar much, I have just batted with him once or twice, once it was in a T20 match and once it was a practice game," said Shardul. "Both of us have that temperament to succeed at this level, honestly we were not looking at the scoreboard, the idea was to spend some time in the middle. We knew their bowlers were tiring, it was a matter of one hour, if we hung in there for one more hour then probably we would be on the top as the bowlers were already tiring. Both of us were communicating really well in the middle, if someone was losing control or trying a rash shot, we were immediately communicating that let's get back to normal," he added. India vs Australia 4th Test: India fight back thanks to Washington Sundar and Shardul Thakur's brilliant counterattackFurther talking about the 123-run stand with Sundar, Shardul said: "We were trying to defend a lot, as our partnership went on, we know there is some true bounce here at Gabba, we were just waiting for our chance, whenever there was a loose delivery, we were trying to put that away. It is a long tour, as a player, it is challenging to stay motivated and do well in the last game, the series is tied at 1-1, this game turns out to be the series decider so you do not need extra motivation, it is about giving 100 per cent for the team." "Australian players were trying to have a conversation with me, but I was not replying. I just replied once or twice, there were a lot of normal questions, even if they were trying to sledge me, I did not hear it, I just played on" he added. 1/8In Pics: Washington Sundar, Shardul Thakur drag India back into Brisbane Test Previous NextShow CaptionsWashington Sundar and Shardul Thakur gave India a fighting chance of securing the draw they need in the fourth Test against Australia to retain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.

We were communicating really well with each other. "When one was playing rash shot, the other was telling to do the basics." Thakur also revealed that the home team players did try to have a go at him verbally but he did not pay attention. "Australian players were trying to have a conversation with me, but I was not replying. I just replied once or twice, there were a lot of normal questions, even if they were trying to sledge me, I did not hear it, I just played on," he said. , https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-80313347,imgsize-710804,width-400,resizemode-4/80313347.jpg
Shardul, Washington batted brilliantly; we faltered in execution: Hazlewood, BRISBANE: Australia speedster Josh Hazlewood on Sunday credited Washington Sundar and Shardul Thakur for taking India to a safe position with their century stand but rued the execution of home team bowlers in finishing off the visitors tail on the third day of the series-deciding fourth Test here. In a spot of bother at 186 for six in reply to Australia's 369, debutant Washington (62) and Shardul (67) punched above their weights to stitch a "crucial" 123-run stand for the seventh wicket to help an inexperienced India finish their first innings at 336, 33 runs short of the hosts. "Yes, it is obviously a crucial partnership (between Shardul and Washington), but then we had them. I think, 6/200 around that mark, so we thought we (were) on top there but to be fair the guys batted really well," Hazlewood, who returned with figures of 5 for 57, said at the virtual post-day press conference. Washington Sundar registers highest score for No.7 debutant in Australia"We didn't probably execute well as we could have in that period but (we) created a few little half chances. On any other day, hopefully we take those, but credit to those two guys (Shardul and Washington). They batted beautifully and I think it just shows the wicket is pretty good." At stumps on day three, Australia were 21 for no loss in their second innings to extend their overall lead to 54 runs. Hazlewood conceded that Australia let a few moments slip in the day, which could have eventually made the difference. No stopping the Newcomers: Washington Sundar, Shardul Thakur keep India in contention"I thought the guys did bowl really well again and everyone else backed us up. Just let a few moments slip, I think, and also a few a half chances there. If we could have grabbed them, it could have made a little difference," the 30-year-old said. Hazlewood also said that the Australian bowlers failed to build enough pressure as they would have liked to against Shardul. 4th Test: India team has shown remarkable character, says Michael Vaughan"It is a bit of frustration obviously, sometimes when you reduce a team to six down and you are on your way to knock them over, but as I said teams bat all the way down, specially some of the teams like England. Credit to him (Shardul), we missed our marking a little-bit in that little period. "Probably bowled a touch short and bit of width here and there and just let him off the hook a little bit there and probably did not build the pressure, the way we wanted to. But again credit to him," he said during the briefing facilitated by official broadcaster Sony Network. 1/8IN PICS: Indian rookies thwart Aussie bowlers on Day 3 Previous NextShow CaptionsAfter their fine show with the ball by grabbing three wickets each, Washington Sundar and Shardul Thakur proved that they are no mugs with the bat either on Day 3 of the 4th Test against Australia at The Gabba.

(AFP Photo)Hazlewood, however, was happy with the fact that they managed to remove India's batting mainstay Cheteshwar Pujara cheaply. "It is huge. He (Pujara) is obviously, probably the key wicket, one of the couple of key wickets there at the top order. If we can knock Pujara early, we get five, six, seven numbers in with a relatively hard and newish ball, so he plays a massive role for them and Patty (Pat Cummins) obviously has been on top of him this whole series," he said. "He has still batted a bit of time here and there but we have really squeezed on the runs and I think that is playing on in his mind and bringing to his downfall." Hazlewood said the match is at present evenly-poised and a call on declaration in their second innings will be made taking into consideration all factors, including the weather. "I think, the way it is set up, it is probably going to be both. Probably depends (on) who bats, if Davy (David Warner) bats a long time, things happen pretty quickly as we know. I think it will be pretty similar to maybe Sydney, three-three and half sessions, maybe four sessions," he said. "It all depends on probably the weather as well, a bit of rain forecast in the afternoon on both days, so that could come into calculations but, we will bat normal for the first two sessions tomorrow and see where we are." , https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-80313481,imgsize-477098,width-400,resizemode-4/80313481.jpg
Making a successful comeback after '10-ball' debut is a dream come true moment: Shardul Thakur, BRISBANE: India fast bowler Shardul Thakur had a nightmare of a Test debut in 2018 as he got injured after bowling just 10 balls but on Sunday said his dream came true after doing well with both bat and ball in the ongoing fourth Test against Australia. Shardul took three wickets with the ball in Australia's first innings and then top-scored for India with a 67 as he got involved with Washington Sundar (62) in a fine rear-guard fightback to keep India in contention. "It was not easy to bowl those 10 balls and get injured. I went back and grinded out in domestic cricket and whatever opportunities I got," Shardul said in an interview taken by senior spinner Ravichandran Ashwin, posted on bcci.tv. R Ashwin turns anchor at the GabbaDecoding a gritty century stand & a fairytale entry to international cricket.‚Ä¶ https://t.co/WbHMXBLRnh‚Äî BCCI (@BCCI) 1610887628000"Waiting for two years to play Test cricket again and getting the wicket (of Marcus Harris) in the very first ball, it is a dream come true. I am happy to contribute to the team's cause." In October 2018, Shardul was forced to leave the field due to a groin strain after bowling just 10 deliveries on the first day of the second Test against the West Indies in Hyderabad. But on Sunday, he and Washington rescued India from conceding a huge lead to Australia. After India were reduced to 186 for 6 in reply to the hosts' 369, the duo stitched 123 runs for the seventh wicket and defied the Australians for 36 overs. In fact, Shardul began his innings with a six and also got to his half-century by hitting a stunning six. Asked about it, he said, "At that point of time I was not looking to hit a six but it was more of a reaction. I saw the ball and played it instinctively. It came out well for me. I am happy about it." On the cover drives he hit, Shardul said, "Honestly, I have not done practice for that but it was one of the days when I was batting really well. I did not want to miss any opportunity and any loose ball. I felt like putting it away. That is it." Washington said Shardul was trying to hit a six off Nathan Lyon and he was not surprised when his batting partner reached to his 50 with a six. For Washington, it was also a memorable debut as he got his first Test wicket in the form of Steven Smith and then got a half century. Asked about it by Ashwin, Washington said, "Test cricket is the toughest format. I am very happy to start off in this fashion. God's grace and a lot of support from the family." Another debutant, pacer T Natarajan said he did not try too much for his three wickets in Australia's first innings. "I did not try too much. I came around the wicket because the plan of the team was that." , https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-80316104,imgsize-448024,width-400,resizemode-4/80316104.jpg
We've begun training with an aim to increase our momentum: Harmanpreet, BENGALURU: The Indian men's hockey core probable group has resumed training following a week-long mandatory quarantine in SAI, Bengaluru. While in quarantine, the players were tasked with high-intensity body-weight training to maintain their fitness levels. Indian men's hockey team drag-flicker Harmanpreet Singh said during the break as well, they were to follow a schedule. "Back home, during the break too we were given a schedule to follow that would ensure we maintain our endurance. When we reported back and underwent mandatory quarantine, we had to ensure we keep up our fitness level and one of the best ways to do that was to go through high-intensity body-weight training in our rooms," Harmanpreet said in a statement. Upon arrival, chief coach Graham Reid informed the team about the appointment of Gregg Clark, the new analytical coach and he further stated his expectations from the players during this national coaching camp via a virtual team meeting. "We are now quite used to having these team meetings via video conference calls though we are in the same campus. We were informed of Gregg's appointment and the coach also took us through his plans for the next few weeks. Our goal is obviously to increase our potential in all aspects and we are all keenly looking forward to working with Gregg. Most of us are quite familiar with him and the transition will be smooth as we understand his working style," stated Harmanpreet. Though the team has not played a competitive match in over ten months, the players are not letting this affect their focus in the lead up to the Olympic Games. , https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-80287211,imgsize-219454,width-400,resizemode-4/80287211.jpg
India vs Australia: Shardul was eager to get to his fifty, I knew a six was coming, says Sundar, BRISBANE (Australia): The record-breaking partnership between India's Shardul Thakur and Washington Sundar was the highlight of day three of the fourth Test against Australia. Interestingly, Shardul began his innings with a six and also got to his half-century by hitting a stunning six. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) posted a video of Ravichandran Ashwin interviewing Shardul, Sundar, and T Natarajan. R Ashwin turns anchor at the GabbaDecoding a gritty century stand & a fairytale entry to international cricket.‚Ä¶ https://t.co/WbHMXBLRnh‚Äî BCCI (@BCCI) 1610887628000Reflecting on beginning his innings by hitting a six, Shardul said: "At that time, I did not look to hit six, it was more of a reaction. I saw the ball and played that shot instinctively and it came out well for me." Ashwin then asked Sundar about how he felt when Shardul struck a scintillating six to get to his fifty. "Starting six is Ok. What about the six to get to his fifty. How did you feel from the non-striker's end," Ashwin asked. To this, Sundar said: "I knew it was coming, to be honest. He was trying for a six to Lyon for some time and I knew it was coming and he was very eager to get to his half-century." Ashwin asked Shardul to talk him through those "Vivian Richards-type cover drives" and the latter said: "I have not really practiced those. It was one of those days where I was batting really well and did not want to miss any opportunity. Any loose ball and I just felt like putting it away." India were bundled out for 336, falling 33 runs short of the hosts' first-innings total. Shardul top-scored for India as he made 67 runs while Sundar accumulated 62 runs. Thakur and Sundar's 123-run resilient partnership enabled visitors to reach the 300-run mark after losing six wickets under 190 runs in the first innings. The duo also registered the highest seventh-wicket partnership for India at The Gabba, Brisbane. Thakur and Sundar broke Kapil Dev and Manoj Prabhakar's 58-run partnership record for the seventh-wicket set in 1991. At stumps, Australia were at 21/0 in their second innings. The hosts are leading by 54 runs. David Warner is unbeaten on 20 runs while Marcus Harris is not out on one run. , https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-80315483,imgsize-142933,width-400,resizemode-4/80315483.jpg
India vs Australia: Shardul Thakur keeps calm, leads India's resistance with bat and ball, NEW DELHI: In 62 matches across eight seasons of first-class cricket, pace bowler Shardul Thakur had scored just six half-centuries. His seventh, at the Gabba for India against Australia in just his second Test, has become most famous and important. The right-arm pace bowler, who picked three wickets in the first innings, hammered 67 off 115 deliveries in a knock that helped India reduce the first innings deficit to just 33. I'm proud that Shardul stuck to my advice: Childhood coach Lad"Having played so much first-class cricket and also for India A definitely helped. The confidence level is high and there is also the desire to move up when you take a leap to Test cricket from first-class level," said Dinesh Lad, who mentored Thakur at his school in Mumbai. Thakur is from Palghar which is three hours away from Mumbai and, due to the distance, the pace bowler initially stayed with Lad at his house. He went to the same school as Rohit Sharma and Lad's son. "This is his natural batting style. He scored 78 and picked five wickets when I saw him for the first time in a school game. That knock of 78 was similarly aggressive. The only difference is that he showed some patience today. His usual batting style is very aggressive," Lad told IANS. Washington-Shardul partnership was outstanding: PontingThakur, 29, himself said that he has talent for batting and had been working at nets. "I have some talent for batting. In nets, I don't just bowl but whenever we have throwdown specialists available with the team, I practice batting too. These moments are the ones for which we wait. So when this opportunity came, I had one thing on my mind, just bat. I thought the longer I stay on the pitch, the more runs I will get and reduce the lead. Idea was to spend time in the middle," Thakur told reporters. I'm no dud with the bat, says unlikely India batting hero Shardul ThakurHe had previously played in Brisbane in 2016 with the India A team. "We were here in 2016. We played a couple of four-day games at the Allan Border Field. Though the pitch there is different. But at least you get used to the climate. You are used to the Australian conditions. So when you take that leap from India A to India team, the transition is not that difficult. It is all about how you execute the plans when you play for the senior teams," Thakur said in reply to a question from IANS on past experience in Australia. 1/8In Pics: Washington Sundar, Shardul Thakur drag India back into Brisbane Test Previous NextShow CaptionsWashington Sundar and Shardul Thakur gave India a fighting chance of securing the draw they need in the fourth Test against Australia to retain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.

Play with straight bat and pitch the ball up to take wickets. That is what he has done," he said. "His advantage is that he bowls outswing unlike others and is also quick." Winning over Aussie crowd was Shardul Thakur's inspiration behind gritty knockBefore his 67 on Sunday, he picked three wickets in Australia's first innings. Two of those wickets came from deliveries pitched up well.

Washington-Shardul partnership was outstanding: Ponting, BRISBANE: Former Australia captain Ricky Ponting has admired the discipline and application of Washington Sundar and Shardul Thakur for their brilliant rear-guard batting effort, which kept India in contention in the series-deciding fourth Test here. Washington (62) and Shardul (67) led a splendid lower-order fightback after India were reduced to 186 for 6 in reply to Australia's 369. The duo stitched 123 runs for the seventh wicket and defied the Australians for 36 overs. "The batsmanship has been a real standout and their application and concentration. They didn't throw it away. The partnership was outstanding, exactly what India needed at the time which is what they've been able to produce in a few Test matches," Ponting told cricket.com.au. Shardul, Washington batted brilliantly; we faltered in execution: Hazlewood"Shardul at the end went for a shot that probably wasn't quite on but before that there wasn't many false shots at all played by either of them." Ponting, however, felt Australia lacked aggression and their fast bowlers should have attacked the Indian lower-order with more short-pitched deliveries. "I don't think they were aggressive enough, didn't bowl enough short balls. They let the Indian batsmen be way too comfortable at the crease. They almost bowled the way those batsmen would have wanted them to bowl," said the legendary batsman. "It wasn't until we saw a bit of a barrage from (Mitchell) Starc and even when Shardul got out (bowled by Pat Cummins), it was no surprise it was a ball after a bouncer. I don't think the Aussies were anywhere near aggressive enough." No stopping the Newcomers: Washington Sundar, Shardul Thakur keep India in contentionPonting said the flat Gabba wicket did not help the lethal Australian fast bowling trio, while also crediting the Indians for their fighting spirit throughout the series. "It's been a bit of a struggle for them (Australian fast bowlers), the wicket's been flat, there hasn't been any sideways movement and certainly no swing. 1/8In Pics: Washington Sundar, Shardul Thakur drag India back into Brisbane Test Previous NextShow CaptionsWashington Sundar and Shardul Thakur gave India a fighting chance of securing the draw they need in the fourth Test against Australia to retain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.

Cornet apologises for 'tactless' remarks on Australian quarantine protocols, Alize Cornet apologised on Monday after many social media users hit out at the Frenchwoman for criticising the country's strict COVID-19 quarantine protocols ahead of next month's Australian Open. Seventy-two players and their entourages have to be isolated for two weeks and cannot leave their hotel rooms in Melbourne to train after infections were reported on three flights ferrying players. Cornet said the situation was "insane" because weeks of training was "going to waste" but was quickly reminded that she was better off than many Victorian residents who endured worse as authorities looked to curb the spread of the virus.

Intercontinental championship title is something I am eager to win. You lost the WWE championships to Daniel last time. Where did you feel you lost the last game and how confident are you going into this matchup?Look, I have known Daniel for a long time and have taken on each other on numerous occasions. Losing the WWE championships was a long time ago but preparing for Daniel is not an easy task. How do you prepare for someone who you know is going to be just like you in the ring. How do you feel the covid-19 pandemic has changed the way professional wrestling is the near future?The whole thing just isn‚Äôt good for anyone and most of us are stuck in quarantine. But the good part is that we are getting to get past over this and the finish line and people are keen to get out of their houses and watch WWE from the stands. It is what it is and we are having some interactions with the fans and it‚Äôs going great. Where do you place someone like Bryan among the list of opponents you have faced in life?There are a lot of great performers but there is something about Bryan which you enjoy. I would place in the list of the greatest of all time because he is that good. You recently moved from RAW to Smackdown. What were the reasons for it and how do you view the whole thing?Smackdown is something I will go home and enjoy myself to. It was one of those things which allowed me to be in Smackdown and I am happy to be here. AJ, CM Punk took a shot at you for not voicing support for the Black Lives Matter movement amid all the protests that‚Äôs going on. How do you react to that?I will not react at all coming from a guy like that I don‚Äôt any respect anyway. It doesn‚Äôt really matter. Look, my job as a performer is to perform and get the mind off all the things that have happened throughout the world. I am not going to react to people saying ridiculous and stupid things. Amidst the gloom around the world, how keen are you to go out there and take on Bryan in the final?I can't wait to be performing in front of the fans. We need the fans and that‚Äôs all that we as performers want. Like I said, I can‚Äôt wait to be back in the ring. At this point of your career, what is it that you aspire to do?After all that has happened in the last few months, I just want to have fun.

Australian Open: Mouse in hotel room adds to Yulia Putintseva's Melbourne quarantine woes, MELBOURNE: If going into strict quarantine ahead of next month's Australian Open was not difficult enough, Kazakhstan's Yulia Putintseva has to contend with an unwanted roommate in the form of a mouse. Putintseva is among 47 players and their entourages who have been asked to isolate for two weeks in their hotel rooms after COVID-19 cases were reported on the two chartered flights that carried them to Melbourne. The world number 28 who arrived on the flight from Abu Dhabi was already upset after claiming she was not told that all the players aboard the plane would be quarantined in case an infection was detected. The condition of Putintseva's room in Melbourne has not helped calm the situation. "Been trying to change the room for two hours already! No one came to help due to quarantine situation," Putintseva said in a post on Twitter that was accompanied by a video of the mouse scurrying about her room. Been trying to change the room for a 2 hours already !

Some social media users have hit out at players complaining about having to strictly stay in hotels, prompting Swiss world number 12 Belinda Bencic to clear the air. "We're not complaining to be in quarantine. We're complaining because of unequal practice/playing conditions before quite important tournaments," she tweeted. Romanian Sorana Cirstea added: "People complaining we are entitled. I have no issues to stay 14 days in the room watching Netflix. Believe me this is a dream come true, holiday even. "What we can't do is COMPETE after we've stayed 14 days on a couch. This is the issue, not the quarantine rule." Other players who arrived in different planes are also undertaking a mandatory 14-day quarantine but are permitted to leave their hotels for five hours a day to train, raising questions about the integrity of the Grand Slam.

WWE confirms wrestler has tested positive for COVID-19, LONDON: The World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) on Tuesday confirmed that a wrestler has recently tested positive for COVID-19. They revealed in their statement that 'a developmental talent' has tested positive but it remains unclear if the athlete was part of the NXT roster or not. "A developmental talent, who was last on site at WWE's training facility on Tuesday, June 9, has tested positive for COVID-19," Jeffery Dugas, WWE's associate medical director, was quoted as saying in the statement by Bleacher Report. "Since that time, no other individuals that attended the facility have reported symptoms. "However, out of an abundance of caution and to ensure the health and safety of the company's performers and staff, all talent, production crew and employees on site at the training and production facilities will be tested for COVID-19 immediately. "Following the test results, WWE plans to proceed with its normal television production schedule." Professional wrestling industry has also been hit by the pandemic as WWE has been forced to host events only at their Performance Center in Orlando. Weekly shows Raw and SmackDown have been allowed to go ahead as per usual while monthly pay-per-view events have also been held without fans in the stands. , https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-76407622,imgsize-14720,width-400,resizemode-4/76407622.jpg

"It wasn't until we saw a bit of a barrage from (Mitchell) Starc and even when Shardul got out (bowled by Pat Cummins), it was no surprise it was a ball after a bouncer. I don't think the Aussies were anywhere near aggressive enough."

Browns coach Kevin Stefanski back to work, Cleveland Browns head coach Kevin Stefanski is out of the basement and back at his office at team headquarters in Berea, Ohio. Stefanski returned to the team after a positive COVID-19 test forced him to isolate in his home last week. Stefanski viewed the team's first playoff win since 1994 from an uncomfortable distance in the bottom floor of his family's home. The Browns beat the Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday night to set up a divisional playoff matchup with the AFC's top-seeded Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday. Stefanski was back at work 10 days after being diagnosed with COVID-19 and was required to test negative before returning to the team. Stefanski said his case was mild but he lost his sense of taste. The Browns didn't have long to savor the wild-card win with Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs awaiting their company at Arrowhead Stadium on Sunday afternoon. Kansas City rested during a bye last week and returned to full practice on Monday. Offensive guard Joel Bitonio, one of the top-rated pass blockers in the NFL, also missed the wild-card game at Pittsburgh due to COVID-19. As of Thursday morning, the Browns had not cleared Bitonio from the reserve/COVID list. , https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-80272321,imgsize-540378,width-400,resizemode-4/80272321.jpg
I'm no dud with the bat, says unlikely India batting hero Shardul Thakur, Regular captain Virat Kohli led the tributes to Shardul Thakur's brave batting in the Brisbane decider but the number eight batsman was underwhelmed by his praise as he never considered himself a dud with the bat. Thakur, playing his second Test, emerged as India's unlikely batting hero, top-scoring with a counter-attacking 67 to deny Australia a substantial first-innings lead. Debutant Washington Sundar was his partner in a 123-run seventh-wicket stand as both made their maiden Test fifties in the fourth and final game of the series on Sunday. They were not even part of India's original squad but were shoehorned into the team following injuries to frontline bowlers. "Outstanding application and belief by @Sundarwashi5 and @imShard. This is what test cricket is all about," Kohli, who returned home after the opening test to attend the birth of his daughter, said on Twitter.

Washy top‚Ä¶ https://t.co/qpVrsJgpVf‚Äî Virat Kohli (@imVkohli) 1610866575000Thakur, who claimed three wickets in Australia's first innings, said he did not want to waste an opportunity to impress with the bat. "I do believe I have some batting talent," the seamer said in a video conference. "I do work on my batting in the nets. We wait for these moments, these opportunities, to contribute with the bat." Thakur brought up his fifty by hitting spinner Nathan Lyon for six and India, reeling at 186-6, were past the 300-mark when Pat Cummins pegged back his off-stump. "We were not even looking at the scoreboard. The idea was to spend some time there," Thakur said. "We knew that their bowlers were tiring out a bit, so if we could hang in for one more hour we could be on top." The 29-year-old said they patiently waited to punish loose balls. "If one of us lost focus or played a rash stroke, we'd immediately communicate with each other and say 'Let's go back to normal and do our basics'," he said. , https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-80313488,imgsize-87044,width-400,resizemode-4/80313488.jpg
India vs Australia: Josh Hazlewood denies Australia fatigued after bowlers humbled by Washington Sundar and Shardul Thakur, Paceman Josh Hazlewood offered no excuses for Australia's laboured display in the field on day three of the fourth Test against India after the hosts' vaunted attack was humbled by Washington Sundar and Shardul Thakur's batting defiance. SCORECARDIn what could prove the defining partnership of the cricket series, debutant Sundar (62) and two-Test tail-ender Shardul Thakur (67) combined for a majestic 123-run stand on Sunday that dragged India back into the conTest on a steamy afternoon at the Gabba. Chasing Australia's first innings 369, the unlikely pair's defiance helped India make 336 in reply after they had been reduced to 186 for six. Hazlewood finished with a five-wicket haul, but there was little else for Australia to celebrate. Their chances of winning the series - level at 1-1 - were diminished, and rain showers are forecast on the final two days. Former players and pundits detected fatigue in the Australians, after the same frontline attack of Hazlewood, Mitchell Starc and Pat Cummins were thwarted by India's injury-hit batsmen on a taxing day five in the drawn Sydney Test. Hazlewood was having none of it. "Everyone pulled up pretty well from Sydney," he told reporters. "Everyone's feeling pretty good, and I think (Cameron) Green makes a huge difference," he added, referring to the pace-bowling all-rounder's support.

Drew McIntyre gears up for the Orton challenge, CHENNAI: Sunday night promises to be a memorable night for the WWE fans as current champion Drew McIntyre will be taking on Randy Orton in the grand finale. Ahead of the keenly-awaited clash, Drew spoke to TOI on facing Randy, how he is different from his previous opponent - Brock Lesnar and more. Excerpts:You had beaten Brock Lesnar to win the WWE championship. Now you defend the crown against Randy Orton on Sunday. How do you view the two opponents?They both are very different. Brock Lesnar is one of the most dangerous competitors and he comes straight at you and you have to pretty much be ready from the word go. Randy Orton, on the other hand, will do whatever it takes to win. He plays a lot of mind games and is very slippery -- and is called a Viper -- a snake. But he is still one of the best in the world and is willing to do whatever it takes and even took on his own friend and mentor Ric Flair. He gives it his all. He is dangerous in the ring. Unlike Brock, he is willing to go the extra mile and play those mind games to get the job done. How do you look at your own chances in the clash?My chances are great. I am the WWE champion and have worked 20 years to get to this position. I am frustrated with Randy and I know that he wants me to get emotional and even get angry which is his goal so that he can use those frustrations and emotions against you. I am not going into that and willing to play the game just like chess. I am willing to go move for move and I am not going to dive in head first. How have your training schedules been affected by the Covid pandemic?I am always watching WWE footage. The other night I was watching Randy Orton vs Edge -- one of the greatest wrestling matches ever. I was watching them in my garage gym and that‚Äôs where I am training now. The day I walked into the gym and they said -- sorry Drew the gym is closing -- I drove back and headed straight to the first store we could find gym equipment. We got some basic stuff and since then I have been slowly building up my garage gym and now it is well set-up. It‚Äôs got a private area and now I train like Rocky (the movie). I watch a lot of footage while I train. Your message to the fans ahead of the key clash‚Ä¶I just want to thank them for watching WWE during these difficult times. We hope to provide everybody an escape in these tough times. We hope to entertain you. The viewers will be treated to a very cool atmosphere and everybody watching it -- thank you, and if you haven‚Äôt watched in a while -- now is the time to check it out. Watch WWE Special: SummerSlam 2020, Live and Exclusive on Sony Ten 1 and Sony Ten 3 (Hindi) on August 24, 4.30am onwards., https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77696165,imgsize-161423,width-400,resizemode-4/77696165.jpg
Hockey India, Odisha government aim to host a memorable 2023 Men's World Cup, NEW DELHI: With exactly two years to go, Hockey India and the Odisha government are gearing up to host the 2023 Men's Hockey World Cup. In 2023, India will host the competition for a record fourth time since its inception in 1971. The tournament is slated to be held in Bhubaneswar and Rourkela from January 13 to 29, 2023. When India hosted the 14th edition of the World Cup in 2018, all the matches of the competition were held at the Kalinga Hockey Stadium in Bhubaneswar, but two venues will be utilised for the 2023 event. Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik, on December 24 last year, announced a new world-class stadium to be constructed in Rourkela city, which would be the biggest stadium for hockey in the country with a sitting capacity of 20,000. The stadium is set to have all the modern facilities and will offer a unique experience to players and the fans during the 2023 World Cup. The work to develop synthetic hockey turf in each of the 17 blocks of Sundargarh district has already begun. "It will be a challenge and an opportunity for us to organize the 2023 World Cup in two venues - Bhubaneswar and Rourkela. Since the World Cup in 2018 was held at the Kalinga Hockey Stadium in Bhubaneswar, most of the arrangements are in place in Bhubaneswar, while a new world-class hockey stadium is being built in Rourkela," said Odisha's Minister for Sports and Youth Services, Tusharkanti Behera. "World-class infrastructure at both venues will enable Odisha to once again deliver a successful and memorable tournament and leave behind a valuable and lasting legacy," he added. The 2023 World Cup being hosted in India holds great significance since the country will be completing 75 years of independence that year. The host federation Hockey India did not want to miss out on the opportunity to showcase the growth of the sport in the country in this landmark year and give the country another reason to celebrate 75 years of independence. Speaking on the preparations for the World Cup, Hockey India president Gyanendro Ningombam said: "It's an absolute honour for us to host the Men's Hockey World Cups back-to-back. "After hosting a successful World Cup in 2018, we are going to ensure that the FIH Men's Hockey World Cup in 2023 will have even better facilities for the players and the fans. It's very exciting to note that we are exactly two years away from the 2023 World Cup." , https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-80246028,imgsize-100940,width-400,resizemode-4/80246028.jpg
EPL: Manchester United retain top spot after Liverpool stalemate, LONDON: Manchester United held onto top spot in the Premier League after grinding out a dour 0-0 draw at title rivals Liverpool on Sunday. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side had the better chances in a strangely subdued clash between two of English football's bitterest rivals. Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker saved well from Bruno Fernandes and Paul Pogba in the second half, but neither side deserved to win. That's 1Ô∏è‚É£6Ô∏è‚É£ @PremierLeague away games without defeat for #MUFC üëä#Ô∏è‚É£ #LIVMUNüèÜ #PL https://t.co/SFemy9Zaez‚Äî Manchester United (@ManUtd) 1610908997000United are three points clear of third placed Liverpool and two ahead of second placed Leicester. United are top after the New Year for the first time since Alex Ferguson's retirement in 2013 thanks to nine wins in an 12-match unbeaten run. Leaving Anfield unscathed is a solid result for United as they chase a first title in eight years, but they might feel it was a missed opportunity to pile pressure on injury-hit Liverpool given their recent struggles. It is the first time these two old foes have been involved in a title race together since 2009 when United, then at their peak, held off Liverpool's challenge. But there was little feel of a seismic encounter as both teams largely played with the handbrake on at an empty and silent Anfield. Brilliant again today, @_fabinhotavares üëè https://t.co/D6kWUmAS6c‚Äî Liverpool FC (@LFC) 1610909083000Liverpool are well short of the dynamic form that carried them to the title last season and the Champions League in 2019. Jurgen Klopp's team have now gone four league games without a win and are without a goal in their last three top-flight matches. Liverpool defender Joel Matip wasn't fit enough to feature, so Jordan Henderson had to play as a makeshift centre-back alongside fellow midfielder Fabinho. Despite that setback, Liverpool dominated a cautious first half with over 65 percent of the possession. They lacked a cutting edge in the final third and Roberto Firmino shot wide before Mohamed Salah volleyed over. It took United 34 minutes to have a shot and they almost took the lead from it as Bruno Fernandes whipped his free-kick inches wide. In an equally scrappy second half, Fernandes forced a good save from Alisson when his effort from Luke Shaw's cross was turned away by the Brazilian's foot. Thiago Alcantara's strike was well saved by David De Gea, while Alisson made another fine stop to deny Paul Pogba's close-range shot. , https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-80317959,imgsize-885188,width-400,resizemode-4/80317959.jpg
India vs Australia: Shardul was eager to get to his fifty, I knew a six was coming, says Sundar, BRISBANE (Australia): The record-breaking partnership between India's Shardul Thakur and Washington Sundar was the highlight of day three of the fourth Test against Australia. Interestingly, Shardul began his innings with a six and also got to his half-century by hitting a stunning six. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) posted a video of Ravichandran Ashwin interviewing Shardul, Sundar, and T Natarajan. R Ashwin turns anchor at the GabbaDecoding a gritty century stand & a fairytale entry to international cricket.‚Ä¶ https://t.co/WbHMXBLRnh‚Äî BCCI (@BCCI) 1610887628000Reflecting on beginning his innings by hitting a six, Shardul said: "At that time, I did not look to hit six, it was more of a reaction. I saw the ball and played that shot instinctively and it came out well for me." Ashwin then asked Sundar about how he felt when Shardul struck a scintillating six to get to his fifty. "Starting six is Ok. What about the six to get to his fifty. How did you feel from the non-striker's end," Ashwin asked. To this, Sundar said: "I knew it was coming, to be honest. He was trying for a six to Lyon for some time and I knew it was coming and he was very eager to get to his half-century." Ashwin asked Shardul to talk him through those "Vivian Richards-type cover drives" and the latter said: "I have not really practiced those. It was one of those days where I was batting really well and did not want to miss any opportunity. Any loose ball and I just felt like putting it away." India were bundled out for 336, falling 33 runs short of the hosts' first-innings total. Shardul top-scored for India as he made 67 runs while Sundar accumulated 62 runs. Thakur and Sundar's 123-run resilient partnership enabled visitors to reach the 300-run mark after losing six wickets under 190 runs in the first innings. The duo also registered the highest seventh-wicket partnership for India at The Gabba, Brisbane. Thakur and Sundar broke Kapil Dev and Manoj Prabhakar's 58-run partnership record for the seventh-wicket set in 1991. At stumps, Australia were at 21/0 in their second innings. The hosts are leading by 54 runs. David Warner is unbeaten on 20 runs while Marcus Harris is not out on one run. , https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-80315483,imgsize-142933,width-400,resizemode-4/80315483.jpg
EPL: Ndombele sparkles as Spurs move back into title race, SHEFFIELD (United Kingdom): Tottenham climbed back into the Premier League title race as Tanguy Ndombele's stunning strike sealed a 3-1 win against Sheffield United on Sunday. Jose Mourinho's side took an early lead through a rare goal from Ivory Coast defender Serge Aurier. Harry Kane's 19th goal of the season the England captain's fourth in his last six games increased Tottenham's advantage before half-time. David McGoldrick got one back for United in the second half, but Ndombele's sublime lob wrapped up the points at Bramall Lane. The wonder-goal was the latest sign of Ndombele turning his Tottenham career around. The 24-year-old's fine form is a stark contrast to his struggles in his first season after arriving from Lyon, with Mourinho admitting the player had to change his mindset to get back on track. Tottenham are on a seven-match unbeaten run in all competitions after winning at Bramall Lane for the first time since 1975. With a home game against champions Liverpool looming next in the league on January 28, Tottenham still have a chance to mount a serious title challenge. They sit fourth in the table, just three points behind leaders Manchester United, who were due to play third placed Liverpool later on Sunday. Meanwhile, after securing their first league win this season against Newcastle in midweek, the bottom of the table Blades remain 11 points from safety after their 16th defeat of the campaign. Mourinho's men made the perfect start as Steven Bergwijn's fierce effort was superbly tipped over by Aaron Ramsdale. From the resulting corner, Aurier rose highest to meet Son Heung-min's delivery with a powerful header past Ramsdale to give Tottenham a fifth minute lead. Tottenham have scored five goals in the opening five minutes of Premier League games this season, more than any other team. Son nearly got on the scoresheet himself moments later when the South Korea forward fired against the post from Kane's pass. With Tottenham on top, it was half an hour before Hugo Lloris had to make a save as he kept out Oliver Burke's shot. Lloris had to save again from John Fleck's effort, but Kane doubled Tottenham's lead in the 40th minute. Taking Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg's pass in stride and shrugging off Chris Basham's challenge, Kane drilled a superb low strike past Ramsdale from 20 yards. Kane's sixth goal from outside the area was more than anyone in the Premier League since the start of last season. He threatened to add another long-range screamer to that list with a thunderous strike tipped over by Ramsdale early in the second half. McGoldrick gave the Blades an unexpected lifeline when he got above Ben Davies to head home from Fleck's cross in the 59th minute. Tottenham's habit of sitting back to defend those leads proved costly when they conceded late equalisers against Fulham, Wolves and Crystal Palace in recent weeks. But Ndombele crushed any hopes of a United comeback in the 62nd minute. Exchanging passes with Bergwijn, Ndombele ran onto his team-mate's lofted ball and, from an acute angle with two defenders draped over him, the French midfielder hooked a brilliant improvised lob over Ramsdale. , https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-80316349,imgsize-128507,width-400,resizemode-4/80316349.jpg

'Sure I will get a big score': Washington Sundar to his dad before Gabba innings, NEW DELHI: While fans and former cricketers are pleasantly surprised at India's tail wagging with No. 7 and 8 scoring half-centuries, Washington Sundar's father is upset at his son for not getting a Test century. Sundar scored 62 off 144 balls and shared a 123-run seventh wicket partnership with Shardul Thakur, who made 67 on the third day of the fourth Test between India and Australia at The Gabba. Sundar was the ninth man to be dismissed. "I am disappointed he did not get a 100. When Siraj came, he should have hit fours and sixes. He is capable of that. He should have gone for sixes. He could have gone for pulls and big hits. Perhaps, he thought of trying to come close to Australia's total as the lead was very less," father M Sundar told IANS from Chennai. Washington-Shardul partnership was outstanding: Ponting"I speak to him in Australia every day. I told him last evening whenever you get a chance, get a big score. He said, 'sure I will'." There is a reason why M Sundar is upset. He knows his son is a very capable top-order batsman although he has been picked in the team only for the lower middle-order. Washington has played only 12 first-class matches but whenever he has got a chance, he has performed. He opened the innings against Mumbai at Lahli in his debut match for Tamil Nadu in the 2016-17 Ranji Trophy season. The ground at Lahli is more of an open field and aids seam bowling. But he shared a 107-run partnership for the first wicket with Abhinav Mukund on that surface. He also made 156 opening for TN against Tripura at the MA Chidambaram Stadium. It is a surprise that he hasn't featured in the TN Ranji side for over three years now. Shardul, Washington batted brilliantly; we faltered in execution: HazlewoodIn the Gabba Test, 21-year-old Sundar became only the third Indian player to score a fifty and take three wickets in an innings on debut. Those who have seen him play from up close, knew this all-round show was coming. Back in 2017, he was called up for the (pink-ball) Duleep Trophy final just a month short of his 18th birthday. The off-spinner and left-handed batsman picked 11 wickets (5/94 and 6/87) and scored 130 runs (88 in first innings & 42 in the second) to help India Red beat an India Blue side that comprised the likes Ishant Sharma, Pankaj Singh and Jaydev Unadkat as well as Suresh Raina. Washington Sundar registers highest score for No.7 debutant in Australia"After that Duleep Trophy performance we all thought he would be in the Test team. But he wasn't picked. We were disappointed," said M Sundar. Washington had first made an impression as a 15-year-old. He was in the NCA U-19 team but was picked in the NCA seniors team for a KSCA tournament. 1/8In Pics: Washington Sundar, Shardul Thakur drag India back into Brisbane Test Previous NextShow CaptionsWashington Sundar and Shardul Thakur gave India a fighting chance of securing the draw they need in the fourth Test against Australia to retain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.

Ozil confirms Fenerbahce move in Turkish TV interview, ISTANBUL: Mesut Ozil confirmed on Sunday that he was leaving Arsenal for Turkish team Fenerbahce after being frozen out for months at the Gunners. "I'm very happy, very excited. God has given me the chance to wear the Fenerbahce shirt. I will wear it with pride and give everything for the team," Ozil said in an interview with Turkish television channel NTV. Former Germany forward Ozil said that he would be travelling to Istanbul with his family on Sunday evening, bringing to an end a seven-and-a-half year relationship with Arsenal that turned sour under current coach Mikel Arteta. The 32-year-old has not played for the Premier League team since March 2020 and his reported deal on a weekly salary of ¬£350,000 ($475,000) was set to expire at the end of the current season. However he claimed in Sunday's interview that he is "in good physical condition" despite his lengthy period on the sidelines. Sports daily Fanatik reports that Ozil will sign a three-and-a-half year deal with Fenerbahce worth five million euros a season. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's spokesman Ibrahim Kalin responding to an earlier post on social media from Ozil of two hearts in Fenerbahce's colours tweeted: "Safe trip home". Ozil, who is of Turkish origin, was heavily criticised in Germany for posing for a photograph with Erdogan in 2018. Erdogan was also the best man at the player's wedding in Turkey. Ozil was a key part of Germany's 2014 World Cup-winning side but after what he labelled "racist" attacks following the holders' first-round exit at the 2018 tournament, he ended his international career. Fenerbahce, one of Istanbul's three big clubs, are currently second in the league behind Besiktas. After starting the first 10 games of Mikel Arteta's reign as Arsenal boss, Ozil has not featured since a 1-0 win over West Ham before the coronavirus pandemic saw football grind to a halt last year. He was omitted from Arsenal's Premier League and Europa League squads, with Arteta and technical director Edu insisting the decision to do so was down to footballing reasons. In December 2019, Arsenal also distanced themselves from comments Ozil made on social media criticising China's treatment of the Uighur population. The early years of Ozil's career at the Emirates after a ¬£42.5 million move from Real Madrid in 2013 were a success. He played a major role in winning three FA Cups in four years, but became a peripheral figure after Arsene Wenger departed as manager in 2018, just five months after Ozil had signed his bumper three-year deal. , https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-80316770,imgsize-696033,width-400,resizemode-4/80316770.jpg
Making a successful comeback after '10-ball' debut is a dream come true moment: Shardul Thakur, BRISBANE: India fast bowler Shardul Thakur had a nightmare of a Test debut in 2018 as he got injured after bowling just 10 balls but on Sunday said his dream came true after doing well with both bat and ball in the ongoing fourth Test against Australia. Shardul took three wickets with the ball in Australia's first innings and then top-scored for India with a 67 as he got involved with Washington Sundar (62) in a fine rear-guard fightback to keep India in contention. "It was not easy to bowl those 10 balls and get injured. I went back and grinded out in domestic cricket and whatever opportunities I got," Shardul said in an interview taken by senior spinner Ravichandran Ashwin, posted on bcci.tv. R Ashwin turns anchor at the GabbaDecoding a gritty century stand & a fairytale entry to international cricket.‚Ä¶ https://t.co/WbHMXBLRnh‚Äî BCCI (@BCCI) 1610887628000"Waiting for two years to play Test cricket again and getting the wicket (of Marcus Harris) in the very first ball, it is a dream come true. I am happy to contribute to the team's cause." In October 2018, Shardul was forced to leave the field due to a groin strain after bowling just 10 deliveries on the first day of the second Test against the West Indies in Hyderabad. But on Sunday, he and Washington rescued India from conceding a huge lead to Australia. After India were reduced to 186 for 6 in reply to the hosts' 369, the duo stitched 123 runs for the seventh wicket and defied the Australians for 36 overs. In fact, Shardul began his innings with a six and also got to his half-century by hitting a stunning six. Asked about it, he said, "At that point of time I was not looking to hit a six but it was more of a reaction. I saw the ball and played it instinctively. It came out well for me. I am happy about it." On the cover drives he hit, Shardul said, "Honestly, I have not done practice for that but it was one of the days when I was batting really well. I did not want to miss any opportunity and any loose ball. I felt like putting it away. That is it." Washington said Shardul was trying to hit a six off Nathan Lyon and he was not surprised when his batting partner reached to his 50 with a six. For Washington, it was also a memorable debut as he got his first Test wicket in the form of Steven Smith and then got a half century. Asked about it by Ashwin, Washington said, "Test cricket is the toughest format. I am very happy to start off in this fashion. God's grace and a lot of support from the family." Another debutant, pacer T Natarajan said he did not try too much for his three wickets in Australia's first innings. "I did not try too much. I came around the wicket because the plan of the team was that." , https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-80316104,imgsize-448024,width-400,resizemode-4/80316104.jpg
Dhyan Chand should get Bharat Ratna: Olympian Harbinder Singh Chimni, NEW DELHI: Hockey wizard and triple Olympic gold medallist Dhyan Chand should definitely be conferred the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour, as he was the first player to get recognition for Indian hockey globally, says 1964 Olympic gold medallist Harbinder Singh Chimni. "Dhyan Chand should definitely get the Bharat Ratna posthumously. He was the first Indian sportsperson to make a special place for himself in international hockey," Chimni, a former India captain, told IANS. "He won three Olympic gold medals. I don't think there is a more deserving sportsperson than him for the Bharat Ratna," emphasised the 77-year-old former centre forward who was once coached by legendary hockey forward. Dhyan Chand was part of three Olympic gold medal-winning Indian teams -- Amsterdam (1928), Los Angeles (1932) and Berlin, where he was also the captain. For two decades, until he bid goodbye to international hockey in 1948, Dhyan Chand's name was synonymous with the sport, both in India and globally, as he scored hundreds of goals across continents. In 2014, legendary cricketer Sachin Tendulkar became the first sportsperson to be conferred with the Bharat Ratna after the government changed its rules that allowed athletes to become eligible for the country's highest civilian honour. And till date, Tendulkar remains the only athlete to be bestowed the Bharat Ratna. Chimni, who was also part of the Indian team that won bronze medals at the 1968 and 1972 Olympics, pointed out some of the numerous efforts made over the years to impress upon successive central governments to honour Dhyan Chand with Bharat Ratna. "We have been requesting the governments for quite some time now, but I don't know why the governments are not paying heed to our requests. I remember after Tendulkar was conferred with the honour, we, alongside Zafar Iqbal and many other former hockey players, had taken out a procession from the statue of Maharaja Ranjit Singh at Barakhamba Road crossing in Delhi to Jantar Mantar, where we also sat down for quite some time just to remind the government," recalled Chimni. Asked about the likelihood of Dhyan Chand being conferred upon Bharat Ratna, Chimni said: "I don't know. It all depends on the government, their criteria, and their thought process." Chimni recalled his interaction with Dhyan Chand many decades ago when he was a player. "Dhyan Chand and my father Balbir Singh also together played for an Army XI in 1948. He was my coach in 1963 when we played an international tournament. Unfortunately, I could not see Dhyan Chand play but during his tenure as coach, he guided us well," recalled Chimni, who was conferred with the Arjuna Award in 1967. "I had a best timing of 10.8 seconds in 100m, so I had the advantage of speed. He told me that as I have the advantage of speed, I should keep the ball in front of me as it will help in pick up and also control the ball. It was the 'guru mantra' that stayed with me and helped me score many goals in my career," he said. Talking about Dhyan Chand's personality, Chimni said legend was like a father figure to him. "He was a very down to earth person and a simple man. He was very humble and used to live a simple life. Whenever a person would talk to him, one would never get the impression that he/she was talking to a legendary player. To me, he was a father figure who always inspired me," stressed an indebted Chimni. The Delhi-based Chimni also appeared in three Olympic Games. At the 1964 Olympics in Tokyo, he was a member of the team that wrested the gold back it had lost to Pakistan four years earlier in Rome. In 1968 in Mexico and in 1972 in Munich, India won bronze medals. Chimni was also a member of the Indian team that won gold at the 1966 Asian Games in Bangkok and was captain of the team that clinched silver four years later at the same venue. He later became chief coach of the Indian women's team and also served as a junior national selection committee. , https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-80254524,imgsize-332511,width-400,resizemode-4/80254524.jpg
Atlanta Falcons close facility after positive COVID-19 test, The Atlanta Falcons have shut down their practice facility after another player tested positive for COVID-19, the National Football League team said on Thursday. The Falcons, who are scheduled to play the Vikings in Minnesota on Sunday, did not identify whether the positive test came from a player or staff member. "Out of an abundance of caution following one new positive test, we have made the decision to stop all in-person work at IBM Performance Field Thursday and will conduct all operations virtually," said the Falcons in a statement on Twitter. "This decision was made in consultation with the NFL and medical officials. The health and safety of our team is our highest priority." The Falcons had implemented the NFL's intensive COVID-19 protocol on Wednesday after placing rookie defensive tackle ?Marlon Davidson? on the reserve/COVID-19 list. Atlanta players will now undergo daily testing, have virtual meetings and wear mandatory protective personal equipment, including masks, during practice. , https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-78685190,imgsize-55296,width-400,resizemode-4/78685190.jpg
India vs Australia 4th Test: India fight back thanks to Washington Sundar and Shardul Thakur's brilliant counterattack, NEW DELHI: India's Washington Sundar and pacer Shardul Thakur stood tall and rescued India from a precarious situation when the team needed them the most. The duo frustrated the Australian bowling attack and notched up their respective maiden Test half-centuries on Day 3 of the fourth and final Test in Brisbane. Shardul and Sundar, who claimed six wickets together in Australia's first innings, held the Indian fortress after India lost Rishabh Pant for 23 runs, leaving India in a lot of trouble at 186/6. Both Sundar and Shardul were tested by short balls, bouncers and swinging deliveries by the Aussie quicks, but the duo refused to give in as they dented Australia's plans with their valiant efforts. Shardul scored a brilliant 67 off 115 balls and stiched a solid 123-run stand with Sundar before being bowled by Pat Cummins. His innings was studded with 9 boundaries and 2 sixes. Sundar became the second Indian player to hit a 50 plus score in a debut batting innings and take three or more wickets in a debut bowling innings. Dattu Phadkar was the first Indian cricketer to achieve the feat. He scored 51 runs and bagged 3/14 against Australia at the SCG way back in 1947/48. Sundar eventually fell for 62 off 144 balls, including 7 boundaries and 1 six. This was also the fourth instance of India forming a 100 plus partnership stand against Australia in Australia for the seventh wicket. Rishabh Pant and Ravindra Jadeja Sydney (204 runs in Sydney, 2018/19), Vijay Hazare and Hemu Adhikari (132 runs in Adelaide, 1947/48) and Mohd Azharuddin and Manoj Prabhakar (101 runs in Adelaide 1991/92) are the other pairs who formed 100 plus stands for the seventh wicket in Australia for India earlier. The partnership between Shardul and Sundar is also the highest for the seventh wicket for India at this venue. The duo broke the record of Kapil Dev and Manoj Prabhakar. Dev and Prabhakar had formed a partnership of 58 runs in 1991. Both Shardul and Sundar were launded for their brilliant show by cricketers.

1st Test: Leach takes five wickets as nervous England near victory, GALLE (Sri Lanka): Left-arm spinner Jack Leach took five wickets as England edged towards victory over Sri Lanka in the first Test in Galle, but they made a nervous start to their pursuit of a modest target of 74 and closed day four on 38 for three on Sunday. Jonny Bairstow (11 not out) and debutant Dan Lawrence (7 not out) will lead the victory charge on the final day but must master a wicket offering prodigious turn that will leave Sri Lanka believing they are still in with a sniff of an upset. South Africa were skittled for 73 in their fourth innings in Galle in 2018 as the home side took 28.5 overs to take 10 wickets, a blueprint for their potential success in this match. England lost opener Dom Sibley (2) in the first over of their chase when he left a delivery from Lasith Embuldeniya (2-13) that clipped his off stump and Zak Crawley (8) soon followed, caught at slip by Kusal Mendis off the same bowler. There was disaster for the visitors when captain Joe Root (1), who scored a superb 228 in the first innings, was run out by a direct his from wicketkeeper Niroshan Dickwella to leave England teetering at 14 for three. It was a needless attempt at a single that showed the nerves of the visitors and Root's fifth run out in Tests since the start of 2018. Earlier, Sri Lanka were bowled out for 359 in their second innings as opener Lahiru Thirimanne scored his second Test century in 37 matches before being dismissed for 111. He was undone by the new ball when a delivery from Sam Curran (2-37) nipped back and was edged through to wicketkeeper Jos Buttler. Off-spinner Dom Bess (3-100) chipped away at the Sri Lanka middle-order, picking up the wickets of nightwatchman Embuldeniya (0), captain Dinesh Chandimal (20) and Dickwella (29) as he finished with eight wickets in the match. All-rounder Angelo Mathews (71) batted well with the tail to frustrate the visitors and allow them to set some sort of target, his 219-ball vigil finally ended by Leach (5-122) when he edged to Root at slip. Leach was getting considerable turn on the crumbling surface and looked threatening with virtually every ball. He provided a first stumping for Buttler in Test cricket when he removed Dilruwan Perera (24). , https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-80314722,imgsize-686003,width-400,resizemode-4/80314722.jpg
Sidelined by COVID-19 bigger issue for NFL players, coaches, NASHVILLE: For Jeffery Simmons, being sidelined by COVID-19 and having to watch his Tennessee teammates beat Buffalo without him hurt. He sat on his couch and tweeted almost a play by play in his desire to get back to work. ``I felt more and more anxious that I really wanted to be on that field, and I was like, `this can't be real that I'm really missing this game,''' said Simmons, who missed only one game and returned to work two days after the Titans' 42-16 win over Buffalo on Oct. 13. The NFL and the players association are trying to play this season during the coronavirus pandemic that has killed more than 220,000 in the United States, with some survivors left dealing with issues months after infection: fatigue, headaches, muscle and joint paints, fuzzy thinking and organ dysfunction. Keeping teams healthy enough for games is why the league and its players association have a lengthy list of guidelines, including daily testing, trying to do just that. Yet the league keeps having to revamp schedules starting with Tennessee and the first COVID-19 outbreak during the season, followed quickly by several positive results in New England. Positive tests have shut down the Atlanta Falcons, Indianapolis Colts and Carolina Panthers at least briefly. Chicago has had a positive test. Now the Raiders' entire offensive line is on the reserve/COVID-19 list after right tackle Trent Brown's positive test with the rest counted as close contacts, and the NFL moved their game with Tampa Bay from prime time to Sunday afternoon. Dr. William Schaffner, professor of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, notes NFL players have an advantage dealing with COVID-19. `` One, the fact that they are extraordinarily fit and healthy and therefore may indeed have fewer of these complications,'' Schaffner said. ``And the other is just as with their getting banged-up on the weekends, they're motivated to get back to work.'' For Simmons, losing his sense of taste and smell were his worst symptoms. Upset stomachs, bad headaches, chills, coughing, diarrhea and sore throats are among the issues reported by other players and coaches testing positive for COVID-19 after clearing the medical testing to return to work. Being sidelined and not able to work was a much bigger issue than being sick. Zoom meetings are nice, but there's no way to play virtually on game day. Patriots quarterback Cam Newton didn't want to talk about any symptoms he had after testing positive. He missed a loss at Kansas City pushed back a day. Further positive tests rescheduled the Patriots' game with Denver by a week. Reigning NFL Defensive Player of the Year Stephon Gilmore said he never had any symptoms after testing positive. He didn't miss a game because of the rescheduling. ``It wasn't easy, but a lot of things in life are not easy,`` Gilmore said. ``You got to be able to take it on the chin and be ready to play. You can't hold your head down, and you have to be mentally strong and go out there and compete for your teammates.'' The Titans, now 5-0, had the biggest outbreak during the season with 24 players, coaches and team staff testing positive between Sept. 24 and Oct. 11. Outside linebackers coach Shane Bowen was packed and ready to fly to Minnesota when he was told on Sept. 26 he had tested positive despite not having any symptoms. Bowen wound up with a fever, chills, a cough but no headaches or trouble breathing. Worse was missing the Minnesota game, a 31-30 Tennessee win in which Bowen was replaced as the defensive play caller by head coach Mike Vrabel. Bowen went into quarantine and started preparing for Pittsburgh on his own, a game later postponed and rescheduled from Oct. 4 to Sunday. Titans safeties coach Scott Booker missed the Bills game. Secondary coach Anthony Midget says he had no symptoms but was stuck watching two games on TV after coaching through Zoom during the week. ``Just me sitting here watching the games and going crazy,`` Midget said. On Tuesday, the NFL and the NFLPA said there were eight new confirmed positive tests among players and 11 new confirmed positives among other personnel in the latest round of testing for the novel coronavirus. Since Aug. 1, 47 players and 71 other personnel have been confirmed positive for COVID-19. Denver star Von Miller and Dallas running back Ezekiel Elliott were among those in the NFL who tested positive for COVID-19 during the offseason. Once training camps opened, several teams had people test positive or come in close contact with someone who had the virus. San Francisco linebacker Fred Warner didn't want to get into what he went through except that being away from the 49ers for 10 days was frustrating. ``At the same time, I'm just grateful it happened when it did and not during the season,'' Warner said. ``That's a blessing. But, yeah, it wasn't a fun process.'' Miami was the team hit the hardest before the season started with a total of 17 Dolphins on the reserve/COVID-19 list, including members of the defensive and offensive lines. Center Ted Karras slept on the guest bed at his house, trying to keep from bringing anything home to his family. Forget any social life, parties or even position group dinners this season in the NFL. Three at a time is the limit for anyone gathering together away from team headquarters or at hotels on the road. ``I think everyone's just going home or just here to the facility,'' Karras said Monday. ``We reported July 28th, and I haven't been anywhere other than my house or the facility.'' , https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-78832051,imgsize-65156,width-400,resizemode-4/78832051.jpg
Washington-Shardul partnership was outstanding: Ponting, BRISBANE: Former Australia captain Ricky Ponting has admired the discipline and application of Washington Sundar and Shardul Thakur for their brilliant rear-guard batting effort, which kept India in contention in the series-deciding fourth Test here. Washington (62) and Shardul (67) led a splendid lower-order fightback after India were reduced to 186 for 6 in reply to Australia's 369. The duo stitched 123 runs for the seventh wicket and defied the Australians for 36 overs. "The batsmanship has been a real standout and their application and concentration. They didn't throw it away. The partnership was outstanding, exactly what India needed at the time which is what they've been able to produce in a few Test matches," Ponting told cricket.com.au. Shardul, Washington batted brilliantly; we faltered in execution: Hazlewood"Shardul at the end went for a shot that probably wasn't quite on but before that there wasn't many false shots at all played by either of them." Ponting, however, felt Australia lacked aggression and their fast bowlers should have attacked the Indian lower-order with more short-pitched deliveries. "I don't think they were aggressive enough, didn't bowl enough short balls. They let the Indian batsmen be way too comfortable at the crease. They almost bowled the way those batsmen would have wanted them to bowl," said the legendary batsman. "It wasn't until we saw a bit of a barrage from (Mitchell) Starc and even when Shardul got out (bowled by Pat Cummins), it was no surprise it was a ball after a bouncer. I don't think the Aussies were anywhere near aggressive enough." No stopping the Newcomers: Washington Sundar, Shardul Thakur keep India in contentionPonting said the flat Gabba wicket did not help the lethal Australian fast bowling trio, while also crediting the Indians for their fighting spirit throughout the series. "It's been a bit of a struggle for them (Australian fast bowlers), the wicket's been flat, there hasn't been any sideways movement and certainly no swing. 1/8In Pics: Washington Sundar, Shardul Thakur drag India back into Brisbane Test Previous NextShow CaptionsWashington Sundar and Shardul Thakur gave India a fighting chance of securing the draw they need in the fourth Test against Australia to retain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.

Twenty-five more players in Australian Open quarantine, MELBOURNE: An additional 25 players will have to spend two weeks in quarantine before the Australian Open, organisers said Sunday, as Covid-19 continues to disrupt preparations for the Grand Slam tournament. The players were on a flight from Doha to Melbourne on which one passenger, who is not one of the players, tested positive for coronavirus having tested negative before the flight. They will join 47 players already confined to their rooms for 14 days in Melbourne, meaning a total of 72 players are now unable to leave their hotel rooms for two weeks. "There were 58 passengers on the flight, including 25 players. All are already in quarantine hotels," tournament organisers said in a statement on Twitter. #AusOpen update... https://t.co/x7m34jhqns‚Äî #AusOpen (@AustralianOpen) 1610888318000"The 25 players on the flight will not be able to leave their hotel room for 14 days and until they are medically cleared. They will not be eligible to practise," the organisers added. Australian Open chief Craig Tiley insisted Sunday, before the announcement that 25 more players were to be quarantined, that the tournament would begin as scheduled on February 8. French player Alize Cornet tweeted on Saturday that the situation was "insane" before later deleting the post. , https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-80316180,imgsize-508802,width-400,resizemode-4/80316180.jpg
NFL reports 19 positive cases, up four from previous week, The number of positive COVID-19 cases in the NFL increased slightly from the previous week, according to numbers released Tuesday by the league and the NFL Players Association. Testing for Oct. 11-17 resulted in 19 new cases, up from 15 the previous week. There were eight positives among players and 11 confirmed positives among other personnel, per the report. There now have been 60 cases in three weeks after 42 in the first six. On this latest report, 38,880 tests were administered to a total of 7,799 players and team personnel. The breakdown: 15,167 tests were administered to 2,459 players; 23,713 tests were administered to 5,340 personnel. Since monitoring began Aug. 1, more than 450,000 tests were administered to players and personnel through Oct. 17. , https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-78775459,imgsize-65156,width-400,resizemode-4/78775459.jpg
No delay to Australian Open despite fourth positive Covid case, MELBOURNE: Australian Open chief Craig Tiley insisted Sunday the Grand Slam would begin as scheduled next month, while admitting it was "not a great situation" for the 47 players who have been confined to their hotel rooms. The tournament was thrown into disarray on Saturday when three people tested positive to Covid-19 on two of the 17 charter flights bringing players and their entourages to Melbourne and Adelaide. A fourth person, a member of a broadcast team on one of the same flights, from Los Angeles, tested positive Sunday. None were players, although one was Sylvain Bruneau, coach of Canada's 2019 US Open winner Bianca Andreescu. Another was also a coach, although they were not identified. Everyone on board was considered to be close contacts and ordered not to leave their hotel rooms for the 14-day mandatory quarantine period. It means 47 players will not be allowed out to train for five hours a day as previously agreed in the build-up to the opening Grand Slam of the year, which is due to start on February 8. The likes of Victoria Azarenka, Sloane Stephens, Kei Nishikori and Angelique Kerber are believed to among those affected, badly impacting their preparations. "We always knew there would be significant risk with this pandemic, you can never tell," Tiley told Channel Nine television. "But the Australian Open is going ahead and we will continue to do the best we possibly can to ensure those players that have what is not a great situation, one that is somewhat acceptable." Organisers quashed rumours about a positive case on one of the two flights to Adelaide carrying some of the game's biggest names. While most players touched down in Melbourne, superstars including Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal, Serena Williams and Naomi Osaka instead flew into the South Australian city. Several players, including Sorana Cirstea and Belinda Bencic, took to social media to complain about not being able to train, with some claiming they were not told about a hard lockdown if one person tested positive. "If they would have told us this rule before i would not play Australia," tweeted Romania's Cirstea, and Kazakhstan's Yulia Putintseva agreed: "I would think twice before coming here," she said. Tiley admitted it was hard, but said they were made aware of the risks. "We did make it very clear at the beginning, that's why we had the player groups in cohorts, there was always a risk that someone would be positive and have to go into 14 days of isolation," he said. "There was a risk on the plane that you would be a close contact, there was a risk that everyone could be a close contact." Some players have already breached the strict lockdown rules by opening their doors. Victoria state Covid-19 quarantine commissioner Emma Cassar warned they faced fines of up to Aus$20,000 (US$15,300) and persistent offenders risked being sent to another hotel with a police officer stationed outside their door. She cited one player "who opened his door to try and have a conversation with his training mate down the hallway", while another bought takeaway food for friends on the same floor "and was praising his great efforts and opened his door to do so". "It is really low-level but really dangerous acts which we just can't tolerate," Cassar said. Tiley said he was doing what he could to ensure affected players had exercise equipment in their rooms. But he acknowledged they would struggle to be ready for a week of lead-in tournaments to start in Melbourne from January 31. Asked if the 47 players would miss those events, he replied: "They have not been ruled out. Obviously at this point, they are not going to get on-court preparation. "If we have to make some adjustments to the schedule we will do whatever we can to make it an environment that is best for the players." The Australian Open had already been hit by the withdrawal of injured Roger Federer, while world number 16 Madison Keys and three-time major winner Andy Murray both tested positive for the virus before departure so did not board their flights to Australia. , https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-80309807,imgsize-336355,width-400,resizemode-4/80309807.jpg
'No room to swing a racket': New Zealand's Artem Sitak shares Australian Open quarantine life, MELBOURNE: As one of the 47 tennis players forced into a hard isolation ahead of the Australian Open, New Zealand's Artem Sitak may be bouncing off the walls of his Melbourne hotel room by the end of his 14-day quarantine. The Russia-born doubles specialist was on flight QR7493 from Los Angeles, sharing the chartered plane with three people who tested positive to COVID-19 after landing in Melbourne. Now, as one of the two-dozen players aboard the flight deemed "close contacts" of the infected trio, Sitak is effectively in solitary confinement at the View Melbourne, an inner city hotel converted into a quarantine facility. Unlike other players who arrived safely and have the luxury of leaving their hotels to train five hours a day, the 34-year-old cannot even open his door for the threat of a A$20,000 ($15,400) fine under Australia's strict quarantine regime. Some players have complained and said they are at a disadvantage compared to better-prepared opponents ahead of the Feb. 8-21 Grand Slam. But Sitak is philosophical, and intends to burn through the hours with exercise, reading and playing games on his Nintendo Switch. "Everything that I did in the off-season ... I had six very good weeks of training, it‚Äôs not completely ruined but it‚Äôs not the same now," he told Reuters in an interview. "Obviously when I come out of the quarantine, we‚Äôre all going to be a little bit rusty. "We‚Äôre going to have to ease into it a little bit because it‚Äôs not easy to be locked down for 14 days. But what can you do with the circumstances?" Sitak gave Reuters a virtual tour of his room, a bland but comfortable enough space with a window that overlooks a city-scape. With no housekeeping available, he laughed that his room was a bit of a mess on day three of quarantine. But there was "amazing coffee", an exercise bike and other fitness equipment that tournament organisers Tennis Australia (TA) had sent to his room. He said he was eating the food served by the hotel but other players were unsatisfied with it and were using a food delivery app instead. "We told Tennis Australia that it‚Äôs not up to the professional tennis player‚Äôs standards, so they are working on improving that," he said. "They gave us the Uber Eats, if we want to order Uber Eats we‚Äôll get extra money in the end with our prizemoney to compensate for that." He praised TA for trying hard to make the best of a difficult situation. Yet he also had sympathy for players concerned about the risks of competing after two weeks stuck in their rooms. "Yeah, definitely, especially for singles players if they have to come out and go play a singles match, it‚Äôs very difficult, it‚Äôs extremely difficult," he said. "I hope for everyone that they‚Äôll be fine and there will be no injuries. It could happen. "But as I said in my (social media) post, we knew the risk we were taking and Australia being very, very strict with their rules concerning the virus ... this was always a possibility." Sitak said he had been impressed by the creativity of Uruguayan Pablo Cuevas, another tennis pro in hard isolation. The world number 68 Cuevas posted video on social media of himself hitting a ball against an upturned mattress in his room and "surfing" on his bed. "That was pretty cool," said Sitak. "He has a pretty big room, so he can actually swing his racket in it. I don‚Äôt think I can swing my racket in this room." , https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-80312033,imgsize-157737,width-400,resizemode-4/80312033.jpg
No stopping the Newcomers: Washington Sundar, Shardul Thakur keep India in contention, BRISBANE: Debutant Washington Sundar and Shardul Thakur punched above their weight with splendid half-centuries to keep Australia at bay and India bullish after an engrossing third day's play in the series-deciding fourth Test here on Sunday. Australia's openers -- David Warner (20) and Marcus Harris (1) -- saw out six overs, and extended the home team's lead to 54 by stumps after India's first innings ended at 336. However, Australia's lead could have been much more had it not been for a delightful 123-run partnership for the seventh wicket between Washington (62) and Shardul (67), who defied and then attacked the rival bowling attack with gusto. Highlights | Scorecard"We knew their bowlers were tiring out a bit so it was a matter of hanging in there for one hour. We knew we probably would be on top if we hung in," said Shardul at the post-play press conference. Pacer Josh Hazlewood finished with a well-deserved 5/57 for Australia, a reward for consistently bowling with an impeccable line and length at a brisk pace. Symbolising the courage shown by the visitors, now rendered almost second-string owing to a plethora of injures suffered by their top players through the four-match series, Washington and Shardul mixed caution with aggression to bail their team out of a precarious 186 for six. India vs Australia 4th Test: India fight back thanks to Washington Sundar and Shardul Thakur's brilliant counterattackFirst, they turned unlikely saviours after three soft dismissals pushed India on the back foot, and in the final session, the two opened up and went after the world-class Australian attack. If his nine fours were not enough, Shardul bludgeoned off-spinner Nathan Lyon, holder of 397 wickets, for a maximum over long-on to reach his maiden Test fifty in style in only his second match.

Playing in his first Test, Washington too soon got to his maiden fifty in the traditional format while finding the fence seven times and clearing it once. He became the first visiting cricketer in Australia in 74 years to grab three wickets and smash a half-century on debut. The one before him was also an Indian, Dattu Phadkar, who made 51 while batting at No.8 and took three wickets during a 1947/48 tour. Earlier, Washington and Shardul did not let Australia run away with the game after Hazlewood sliced through India's middle-order with the wickets of Mayank Agarwal (38) and Rishabh Pant (23) at the start of the second session. 4th Test: India team has shown remarkable character, says Michael VaughanAt tea break, India trailed Australia's first-innings total of 369 by 116 runs at the Gabba. This was largely due to the fight put up by Washington and Shardul who played their strokes without worrying about the end result, frustrating the high-quality Australian attack with their carefree approach. However, India were in a spot of bother before their counter-attacking act. If the visitors lost the big wicket of skipper Ajinkya Rahane (37) to a poor shot at the stroke of lunch, they were dealt another blow right after the break when the persevering Hazlewood lured Agarwal into a loose drive for Steve Smith to complete a catch at second slip on the rebound. 1/8In Pics: Washington Sundar, Shardul Thakur drag India back into Brisbane Test Previous NextShow CaptionsWashington Sundar and Shardul Thakur gave India a fighting chance of securing the draw they need in the fourth Test against Australia to retain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.

At that stage Australia were still ahead by 183 runs. This was after Mitchell Starc induced a thick edge off Rahane for Matthew Wade to complete a comfortable catch in the slip cordon after the India captain had gotten away with similar shots twice in the first hour of play. It was a shot that the seasoned Rahane could have definitely avoided. 01:404th Test: Sundar, Thakur drag India back on Day 3Earlier, Cheteshwar Pujara (25) added 43 runs with Rahane before falling to a near unplayable delivery by Hazlewood in only his second over of the day. Until Pujara's dismissal, the experienced duo raised hopes of a big partnership by negotiating the formidable attack in the first one hour of play. Pujara was his usual solid self while Rahane was a bit more adventurous and lucky as the ball flew past the gap between gully and third slip for boundaries on two occasions. 1/8IN PICS: Indian rookies thwart Aussie bowlers on Day 3 Previous NextShow CaptionsAfter their fine show with the ball by grabbing three wickets each, Washington Sundar and Shardul Thakur proved that they are no mugs with the bat either on Day 3 of the 4th Test against Australia at The Gabba.

Introduced into the attack after 11 overs had been bowled in the day, Lyon saw Rahane rock back on to the back-foot and play the cut shot against the off-spinner for a four through point. Bowling in the channel just outside the off-stump, Hazlewood got one to straighten a bit after angling it in. Pujara had no answer as the ball took an edge through to captain Tim Paine behind the stumps. Returning to the side after sitting out the third Test, Agarwal showed intent as he looked to keep the scoreboard ticking in the company of his captain. Batting at number five instead of the opening slot, Agarwal's first boundary was a fortuitous one as a thick edge off Cummins flew between second slip and gully. His second boundary was much better as Agarwal glanced Starc down the leg side. More convincing was Agarwal's six over long-on off Lyon but the best was the classic straight drive he played against Starc. , https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-80312768,imgsize-163076,width-400,resizemode-4/80312768.jpg
Nikki Cross gears up for her clash with Bayley, CHENNAI: Nikki Cross will be looking to pocket her maiden singles crown when she takes on Bayley --- the SmackDown Women‚Äôs Champion --- on Sunday. After creating a huge impact with Alexa Bliss, Nikki is ready to showcase her prowess as a singles competitor as well. In a chat with TOI, Nikki speaks about her growing years in Glasgow, the final against Bayley and more. Excerpts:Could you talk to us about the WWE Extreme Rules and how excited are you to be part of it?I am so excited to be part of it. I will be competing for the WWE SmackDown women's championship with Bayley and this is a match I have been working on for a long time. This is my first ever singles opportunity and so for me --- I am excited, nervous and can‚Äôt wait till Sunday to be part of it. My trainer has been unbelievable and I have trained very hard for this match. Whom did you idolize growing up in Scotland?For me, growing up I admired Mickie James, Trish Stratus, Beth Phoenix and many others. I began watching WWE when I was 10. I watched it with my family and my sister. I was just hooked right from the beginning because it was just a lot of action. When I was studying at University of Glasgow, I decided to join a training school. How would you describe your style of wrestling?I think my style of wrestling is very distinct and very Scottish. It‚Äôs just me and no one can replicate that. I just want to be myself and it comes out as something unorthodox. How has your family supported you in your endeavours?My mother knew that we --- me and my sister --- had watched WWE. I told her that I want to do this, and she didn‚Äôt take it that seriously. But when WWE NXT came to Scotland, she came to watch. She loved the show and she loved the characters. My mother has been very supportive. How has the last few months been especially with Covid-19 pandemic having affected all walks of life?The whole world has changed. We want to give people hope even if it is for a couple of hours. As WWE Superstars, we want to put a smile on people‚Äôs faces and it‚Äôs the truest statement. We want our fans to know that we are here for them and our thoughts are with them. Any message for Bayley ahead of the match‚Ä¶I am 100% confident --- going into the match on Sunday. This is my time, and my chance to win my first ever singles Smackdown championship.

India vs Australia: Shardul Thakur keeps calm, leads India's resistance with bat and ball, NEW DELHI: In 62 matches across eight seasons of first-class cricket, pace bowler Shardul Thakur had scored just six half-centuries. His seventh, at the Gabba for India against Australia in just his second Test, has become most famous and important. The right-arm pace bowler, who picked three wickets in the first innings, hammered 67 off 115 deliveries in a knock that helped India reduce the first innings deficit to just 33. I'm proud that Shardul stuck to my advice: Childhood coach Lad"Having played so much first-class cricket and also for India A definitely helped. The confidence level is high and there is also the desire to move up when you take a leap to Test cricket from first-class level," said Dinesh Lad, who mentored Thakur at his school in Mumbai. Thakur is from Palghar which is three hours away from Mumbai and, due to the distance, the pace bowler initially stayed with Lad at his house. He went to the same school as Rohit Sharma and Lad's son. "This is his natural batting style. He scored 78 and picked five wickets when I saw him for the first time in a school game. That knock of 78 was similarly aggressive. The only difference is that he showed some patience today. His usual batting style is very aggressive," Lad told IANS. Washington-Shardul partnership was outstanding: PontingThakur, 29, himself said that he has talent for batting and had been working at nets. "I have some talent for batting. In nets, I don't just bowl but whenever we have throwdown specialists available with the team, I practice batting too. These moments are the ones for which we wait. So when this opportunity came, I had one thing on my mind, just bat. I thought the longer I stay on the pitch, the more runs I will get and reduce the lead. Idea was to spend time in the middle," Thakur told reporters. I'm no dud with the bat, says unlikely India batting hero Shardul ThakurHe had previously played in Brisbane in 2016 with the India A team. "We were here in 2016. We played a couple of four-day games at the Allan Border Field. Though the pitch there is different. But at least you get used to the climate. You are used to the Australian conditions. So when you take that leap from India A to India team, the transition is not that difficult. It is all about how you execute the plans when you play for the senior teams," Thakur said in reply to a question from IANS on past experience in Australia. 1/8In Pics: Washington Sundar, Shardul Thakur drag India back into Brisbane Test Previous NextShow CaptionsWashington Sundar and Shardul Thakur gave India a fighting chance of securing the draw they need in the fourth Test against Australia to retain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.

Play with straight bat and pitch the ball up to take wickets. That is what he has done," he said. "His advantage is that he bowls outswing unlike others and is also quick." Winning over Aussie crowd was Shardul Thakur's inspiration behind gritty knockBefore his 67 on Sunday, he picked three wickets in Australia's first innings. Two of those wickets came from deliveries pitched up well. The one that removed Paine moved away and had him caught in slips. , https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-80315679,imgsize-348025,width-400,resizemode-4/80315679.jpg
Making a successful comeback after '10-ball' debut is a dream come true moment: Shardul Thakur, BRISBANE: India fast bowler Shardul Thakur had a nightmare of a Test debut in 2018 as he got injured after bowling just 10 balls but on Sunday said his dream came true after doing well with both bat and ball in the ongoing fourth Test against Australia. Shardul took three wickets with the ball in Australia's first innings and then top-scored for India with a 67 as he got involved with Washington Sundar (62) in a fine rear-guard fightback to keep India in contention. "It was not easy to bowl those 10 balls and get injured. I went back and grinded out in domestic cricket and whatever opportunities I got," Shardul said in an interview taken by senior spinner Ravichandran Ashwin, posted on bcci.tv. R Ashwin turns anchor at the GabbaDecoding a gritty century stand & a fairytale entry to international cricket.‚Ä¶ https://t.co/WbHMXBLRnh‚Äî BCCI (@BCCI) 1610887628000"Waiting for two years to play Test cricket again and getting the wicket (of Marcus Harris) in the very first ball, it is a dream come true. I am happy to contribute to the team's cause." In October 2018, Shardul was forced to leave the field due to a groin strain after bowling just 10 deliveries on the first day of the second Test against the West Indies in Hyderabad. But on Sunday, he and Washington rescued India from conceding a huge lead to Australia. After India were reduced to 186 for 6 in reply to the hosts' 369, the duo stitched 123 runs for the seventh wicket and defied the Australians for 36 overs. In fact, Shardul began his innings with a six and also got to his half-century by hitting a stunning six. Asked about it, he said, "At that point of time I was not looking to hit a six but it was more of a reaction. I saw the ball and played it instinctively. It came out well for me. I am happy about it." On the cover drives he hit, Shardul said, "Honestly, I have not done practice for that but it was one of the days when I was batting really well. I did not want to miss any opportunity and any loose ball. I felt like putting it away. That is it." Washington said Shardul was trying to hit a six off Nathan Lyon and he was not surprised when his batting partner reached to his 50 with a six. For Washington, it was also a memorable debut as he got his first Test wicket in the form of Steven Smith and then got a half century. Asked about it by Ashwin, Washington said, "Test cricket is the toughest format. I am very happy to start off in this fashion. God's grace and a lot of support from the family." Another debutant, pacer T Natarajan said he did not try too much for his three wickets in Australia's first innings. "I did not try too much. I came around the wicket because the plan of the team was that." , https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-80316104,imgsize-448024,width-400,resizemode-4/80316104.jpg
Shardul, Washington batted brilliantly; we faltered in execution: Hazlewood, BRISBANE: Australia speedster Josh Hazlewood on Sunday credited Washington Sundar and Shardul Thakur for taking India to a safe position with their century stand but rued the execution of home team bowlers in finishing off the visitors tail on the third day of the series-deciding fourth Test here. In a spot of bother at 186 for six in reply to Australia's 369, debutant Washington (62) and Shardul (67) punched above their weights to stitch a "crucial" 123-run stand for the seventh wicket to help an inexperienced India finish their first innings at 336, 33 runs short of the hosts. "Yes, it is obviously a crucial partnership (between Shardul and Washington), but then we had them. I think, 6/200 around that mark, so we thought we (were) on top there but to be fair the guys batted really well," Hazlewood, who returned with figures of 5 for 57, said at the virtual post-day press conference. Washington Sundar registers highest score for No.7 debutant in Australia"We didn't probably execute well as we could have in that period but (we) created a few little half chances. On any other day, hopefully we take those, but credit to those two guys (Shardul and Washington). They batted beautifully and I think it just shows the wicket is pretty good." At stumps on day three, Australia were 21 for no loss in their second innings to extend their overall lead to 54 runs. Hazlewood conceded that Australia let a few moments slip in the day, which could have eventually made the difference. No stopping the Newcomers: Washington Sundar, Shardul Thakur keep India in contention"I thought the guys did bowl really well again and everyone else backed us up. Just let a few moments slip, I think, and also a few a half chances there. If we could have grabbed them, it could have made a little difference," the 30-year-old said. Hazlewood also said that the Australian bowlers failed to build enough pressure as they would have liked to against Shardul. 4th Test: India team has shown remarkable character, says Michael Vaughan"It is a bit of frustration obviously, sometimes when you reduce a team to six down and you are on your way to knock them over, but as I said teams bat all the way down, specially some of the teams like England. Credit to him (Shardul), we missed our marking a little-bit in that little period. "Probably bowled a touch short and bit of width here and there and just let him off the hook a little bit there and probably did not build the pressure, the way we wanted to. But again credit to him," he said during the briefing facilitated by official broadcaster Sony Network. 1/8IN PICS: Indian rookies thwart Aussie bowlers on Day 3 Previous NextShow CaptionsAfter their fine show with the ball by grabbing three wickets each, Washington Sundar and Shardul Thakur proved that they are no mugs with the bat either on Day 3 of the 4th Test against Australia at The Gabba.

(AFP Photo)Hazlewood, however, was happy with the fact that they managed to remove India's batting mainstay Cheteshwar Pujara cheaply. "It is huge. He (Pujara) is obviously, probably the key wicket, one of the couple of key wickets there at the top order. If we can knock Pujara early, we get five, six, seven numbers in with a relatively hard and newish ball, so he plays a massive role for them and Patty (Pat Cummins) obviously has been on top of him this whole series," he said. "He has still batted a bit of time here and there but we have really squeezed on the runs and I think that is playing on in his mind and bringing to his downfall." Hazlewood said the match is at present evenly-poised and a call on declaration in their second innings will be made taking into consideration all factors, including the weather. "I think, the way it is set up, it is probably going to be both. Probably depends (on) who bats, if Davy (David Warner) bats a long time, things happen pretty quickly as we know. I think it will be pretty similar to maybe Sydney, three-three and half sessions, maybe four sessions," he said. "It all depends on probably the weather as well, a bit of rain forecast in the afternoon on both days, so that could come into calculations but, we will bat normal for the first two sessions tomorrow and see where we are." , https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-80313481,imgsize-477098,width-400,resizemode-4/80313481.jpg
Winning over Aussie crowd was Shardul Thakur's inspiration behind gritty knock, BRISBANE: When Shardul Thakur stepped out to bat on Sunday, rescuing India from a precarious 186/6 was not the only target on his mind as he was also keen to impress the Australian crowd after being told how "rewarding" it would feel by coach Ravi Shastri. India were staring down the barrel at 186 for six on the third day of the fourth and final Test but Thakur (67) joined hands with debutant Washington Sundar (62) for a combative 123-run seventh wicket stand which helped his team cut down Australia's first innings lead to just 33 runs. I'm no dud with the bat, says unlikely India batting hero Shardul Thakur"When I walked in, the situation was difficult. I would not deny that. The crowd was cheering for Australians bowlers. But I remembered our coach Ravi Shastri saying right at the start of the One-day series that 'if you perform in this country, you will be rewarded'," Thakur talked about the inspiration behind the unfazed manner with which he batted. "People will love you for your performances and that one thing was also on my mind that people are going love me. Batting at number eight, Thakur impressed with his stroke-play, his drives coming straight out of coaching manuals. At stumps, Australia were 54 ahead after reaching 21 for no loss in their second innings following India's dismissal for 336. "Eventually at the end of the day it would help my team, that was the biggest positive. These two things were on my mind. Crowd would make noise, but If I bat well, the same crowd will cheer for me," Thakur said at a virtual post-play press conference. Cheered, he definitely was by not just the crowd but also his teammates, who gave him a standing ovation on his way back to the dressing room. Thakur spoke about his love for batting and how he waited for such an opportunity. "I have some batting talent. Whenever the throw-down specialists with the team are available, I practice. These are the moments you train and wait for and you could so something for the team. The idea was to spend time, it would add runs and deficit will also decrease." He also admitted that travelling with the A team in this part of the world has helped him improve his skills. 1/8IN PICS: Indian rookies thwart Aussie bowlers on Day 3 Previous NextShow CaptionsAfter their fine show with the ball by grabbing three wickets each, Washington Sundar and Shardul Thakur proved that they are no mugs with the bat either on Day 3 of the 4th Test against Australia at The Gabba.

India have earned plaudits for a lion-hearted effort despite being ravaged by injuries with Thakur and Washington being the latest set of newcomers to rise to the occasion. Thakur said the key in their partnership on Sunday was clear communication. "I have not batted with him much. Once in a T20 match and once in a practice game. Both of us have the temperament to succeed at this level. Honestly we were not looking at the scoreboard. The idea was to spend some time," he said. India vs Australia: 'A' tours have made transition to senior side easier, says Shardul Thakur"We knew their bowlers were tiring out a bit so it was a matter of hanging in there for one hour, we knew probably we will be on top, if we hang in. We were communicating really well with each other. "When one was playing rash shot, the other was telling to do the basics." Thakur also revealed that the home team players did try to have a go at him verbally but he did not pay attention. "Australian players were trying to have a conversation with me, but I was not replying. I just replied once or twice, there were a lot of normal questions, even if they were trying to sledge me, I did not hear it, I just played on," he said. , https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-80313347,imgsize-710804,width-400,resizemode-4/80313347.jpg
